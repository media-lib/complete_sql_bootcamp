            <h4>ASSESSMENT TEST 2</h4>

<p><strong><em>Remember you need to restore the exercises database and use the cd schema!</em></strong></p>



<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">****************</strong><br></p>



<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Note: Having trouble unzipping the file from the previous lecture? You can download an already unzipped version of the database here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pfvb3sjjv6tpxid/no_unzip_exercises?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dropbox Link for Unzipped Version of exercises .tar file</a></strong><br></p>
