00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,830
Hello everyone and welcome to the Mac OS database setup.

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,530
So this lecture is going to show you how to use the zip file from the previous lecture and set up your

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,830
database for the course in order to open and extract the zip file you may need to download some free

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,760
software.

00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,680
I personally recommend downloading WW.

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:29,540
Isaac Dotcom's file or software the AIs application that will allow you to open an extra zip files.

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,710
So again if you haven't already go back to the previous lecture and download from the resources section

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,320
the DVD rental that's it.

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,040
File.

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,160
If you're using a Mac and haven't downloaded it is it file or extraction software.

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,550
Could it delete WW.

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,650
Is it dot com.

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,090
Which I'll show you in just a second and download the isip program in order to extract zip files.

00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,050
I should note sometimes the default archive utility won't work for this step meaning if you try unzipping

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,830
the file using archive utility the default for a Mac.

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,020
Sometimes it won't work.

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,580
So a quick note on the database are going to be using the common learning sample database.

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,260
This Aqeel a database known as the package.

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,710
Or put Jilla.

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,970
Depending how you want to pronounce it database for postgresql.

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,940
Couple of reasons why this is a great database one.

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,140
It's a really common database for examples and two it's really easy to use as a reference tool.

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,400
So that means if you look up online documentation more often than not they'll be using this particular

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,880
database to show off their examples.

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,090
Meaning since you've learned them this database throughout this course it's going to be really easy

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,070
to hop around two different examples.

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,670
If she's in a database you're already familiar with.

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,420
So this database kind of reflects a chain of DVD rental stores.

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,380
So it's also really easy to understand what each of the tables represents such as customers DVDs films

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,520
actors languages etc..

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,710
Ok once you've completed this lecture you can go ahead and jump straight to the lecture title challenge

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,610
restore a database to a couple of lectures ahead of this.

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,050
From that lecture onwards this course will be relatively Ogust at trial meaning whether using a Mac

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,150
or Windows everything should look exactly the same as far as the sequel queries are concerned.

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,310
With that being said lets go ahead and hop to my desktop and show you what you need to know and actually

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,560
go through the process of setting up our new database and filling it with the data we need.

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm going to go ahead and jump to my desktop now.

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,050
OK so here I am at my desktop and what I wanted to show you that in case you don't have Zipp software

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,070
we should do is go to WW w the eyes dot com and scroll down and download for free.

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,360
This isip software is completely free so you don't need to pay for any sort of license here and it's

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,580
a really nice way to manage and unzip and extract information from that zip files.

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,890
Once you've done that go ahead and locate the DVD rental that zip file that you downloaded from the

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,690
previous lecture.

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,170
For me it's located right here on my desktop DVD rental.

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,450
That's it.

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,840
Go ahead.

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Right click on it say open with don't use the archive utility default.

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,550
Instead go to other.

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,400
This will show you a list of all your applications.

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,770
Enable all applications.

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,380
Click.

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,670
I go down to the applications and then you should see isip after you've downloaded it.

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,580
Granted maybe you're using another Zipp software.

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,050
As long as you feel comfortable using that and everything works out the same as it does isip that's

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,000
OK too.

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,670
But let's go ahead and click open of isip.

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,960
And now we have DVD rental and you should see DVD rental tar.

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,060
That's exactly the file we need.

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,790
Everything's ready to go if he tried doing the same step with archive utility default.

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:05,190
You may have gotten a folder that looks something like this with a bunch of DJT files in a restore that

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,800
sequel file.

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,560
It's going to be a lot harder to use these files to restore the database.

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,380
So make sure that when you extracted the database it ended up giving you a tar file.

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,950
That's kind of important for the next step.

00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Again if you're getting something that looks more like this with the D 80 files and finally a restore

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,820
that sequel download I.

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,580
That's it.

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,510
And make sure you can extract it so that it looks like a duck tar file instead.

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,490
OK with that being said once we have that all set up on our desktop the next step is to restart database

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,770
mpg admin.

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:50,200
Go ahead and do command space and search for PGE admin then click enter to open it let's go ahead and

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,800
expand this a little bit so it's easier to see.

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,510
So this is a PGE admin should look like should have servers here.

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,940
Go ahead and double click on postscripts sequel 9.5.

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,510
You'll be prompted for your password.

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
Go ahead and put it in.

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,460
And if you don't want to be prompted for your password every time you can just click here and say store

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,800
password click OK.

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,220
They'll give you a warning about showing passwords.

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,600
Don't just say don't show this again and click OK.

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,200
All right.

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,820
Now we're ready to actually make a database where we can do is you can see already have a couple of

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,280
databases made here.

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,140
You will probably only have this post-crash sequel or postgresql database in order to create a new database

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,170
.

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,920
Go ahead and right click on database and click new database then just put in the name of the database

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:49,900
you want we'll call this new DVD database and then click OK once you've done that you should see the

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,700
new database pop up here.

00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:00,400
Now if you go ahead and click on the dropdown menus you'll see schema public and then all the way down

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,770
here you'll see tables equals zero.

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,910
So that means what we do have a database.

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,820
You don't actually have any data in it.

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,670
So the next step is to do that is to use that tar file in order to fill out the data for our database

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,000
.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,990
So we're going to do so if we go ahead and right click on new DVD database that database that we just

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,980
created.

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,730
Go ahead and click on restore.

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,480
You should see something like this pop up where format custom or tar and then file name what you're

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,200
going to want to do is go ahead and clear that.

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,370
And once you've cleared that file name go ahead and then click on these three dots.

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,400
And what you want to do now is figure out where a DVD rental the tar file is.

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,730
So for me it's on my desktop.

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,130
But if we actually look to where my desktop is it's actually presented as a drive or a device.

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,870
So it's going to be listed under devices here under DVD rental suffuse.

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,350
If you use the isip application program to do this they'll probably be under devices if you use something

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,940
else.

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,620
It'll be wherever the DVD rental that zip files located.

00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,070
Go ahead and find the tar file.

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,980
If you can't click on it it's because you haven't enabled it as selectable.

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,060
So go ahead and go to enable all files and then you can go ahead and click the tar file here then click

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,280
open and then just click restore.

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,350
You should see some messages pop up and then if process return exit code 0 means you're done.

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,570
Go ahead and click on here.

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,800
And if we go ahead and refreshed this database so new DVD database go ahead and click refresh.

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,470
And now if we scroll down to the tables you have all the tables available to you and your database is

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,730
now full of data.

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,890
So just to make sure everything's working correctly.

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,050
Go ahead and click new DVD database or whatever you decided to name or database.

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,490
Click here on the little magnifying glass that says execute arbitrary sequel query.

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:18,730
You should see something that looks like this and go ahead and say select space Asterix from actor semi-colon

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,130
and you actually don't have to uppercase select and from and we'll show you how to do these sort of

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,660
queries later on.

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,900
But if you just go ahead and select this execute query this play button and if you get data output coming

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,230
out of this.

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,380
So down here if you get data output that means everything's ready to go and you're more than ready to

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,110
go ahead and tackle the rest of the Course now.

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,310
Now you can go ahead and feel free to jump directly to the challenge lecture and the child's lecture

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,860
is just going to ask you to basically repeat all the steps we just did in order to practice for storing

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,870
a database.

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,740
Go ahead and don't worry about saving that queery for now.

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,860
As a quick review let me just go over everything we just did to restore this database.

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,720
OK let's quickly go over all the steps you just did it for creating that database.

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:14,740
You had to download a DVD rental that zip file from the previous lecture download or already use your

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,300
favorite zip application file to extract stuff from that zip files.

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,550
I recommend going to w w w dot izip dot com.

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,050
Then open an extract DVD rental tar file from the DVD rental a zip file using ise it.

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,460
Then you had a search for PGE adamant three and open it.

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,740
Then you had a double click on postgresql 9.5 to go ahead and see those databases dropdown.

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,150
Then right click on the database's icon and then select new database and then you could have been naming

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,400
your new database and then you select one that was for creating a database.

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,210
After that we restored the database there.

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,720
To do that you had to right click on that new database and select restore you to find the path to the

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,060
DVD rental that tar file and remember to enable all the file extensions.

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,760
Then you have to select it and click on the restore.

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,540
After that we had to just click the refresh button with your database selected and then you should now

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,580
be able to see the table 15 in the dropdown menu of your database and you can test this like we just

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,160
did by executing an arbitrary siecle query on the database.

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
OK so all these steps are lined up for you.

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,040
In both the previous lecture and then the next lecture is a quick article summarizing what we just did

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,640
.

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,500
OK so if you have any questions go ahead and ask a discussion question.

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,900
Sometimes installing and restoring these databases can be tricky.

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,290
So always feel free to ask any discussion questions.

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,910
All right.

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,520
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
