Mac OS X and then you'll notice there's a graphical installer.

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,730
So go ahead and download that graphical installer.

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,380
You can go ahead and close any pop ups that happen.

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,060
So this will take you to the download postgresql page depending on what what say you go to.

00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,490
It may be hosted on like Enterprise D-B dot com.

00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,430
Don't worry about that.

00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,260
It's just like some free hosting service.

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,470
So again you'll see download post sequel and then go ahead and click for the latest version.

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,520
At this point it's nine point 5.1 at the time of the filming of this lecture video.

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,220
Go ahead and download the latest version and then click.

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,960
Mac O S X..

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,780
So go ahead and download that.

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,030
That doesn't download you can always click here you'll download the DMG file.

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,840
Let's go ahead and save that and then wait for the download.

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,060
So I'll go ahead and jump to the Stallard being finished.

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,900
So now that it's finished downloading Let's go ahead and click on that file.

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,560
You'll go ahead and see that it's opening.

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,130
And so now that we have this open we can go ahead and double click this file and you'll notice you may

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,730
get a warning.

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,780
Here you can just go ahead and click the on me and then you can go and open that you may be prompted

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,800
for your password.

00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,060
Go ahead and type that in.

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,710
Click OK and you'll notice it'll get the postgresql sequel installer running.

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
So you have a little set up wizard.

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,610
Just go ahead and follow the directions.

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,470
You can specify a specific directory where post-procedure will be installed.

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm going to go ahead and go of the defaults here again David their victory just the default.

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,380
Here's the important part.

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,790
You're going to need to provide a password for the database.

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,930
Superuser.

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,460
Get into what a super user is later.

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,650
But go ahead and type a password here and retype it.

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,000
But make sure you write this password down somewhere.

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:38,730
You can go ahead and be the same as the password to your laptop computer or your just your Mac.

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,750
So go ahead and type in that password.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,460
Remember you should write this down and you should remember it.

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,310
You'll get a port here.

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,990
Five four three two that it should be listening on.

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,070
Go ahead and leave that as the default and you may get some selection.

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,570
Go ahead and keep that the fault for the locale and then go ahead and click next and it's going to go

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,500
ahead and install that.

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,550
And you'll notice it installs it pretty dang fast.

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,130
So go ahead and let it happen.

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,510
This may take a couple of minutes and we'll go ahead and let that happen.

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,750
So you'll see a stack builder.

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,470
Go ahead and just don't install that and click Finish.

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,340
Now that we've installed postscripts sequel we're gonna want to install a PGE admin which is a GeoEye

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,310
or graphical user interface which is going to help us get things up and running quickly.

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,680
And it's one of the primary tools people use when working with a postgresql database.

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,760
So go ahead and go to w w w that PGE adamant that orch going to go ahead and jump to that my browser

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,470
now.

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,850
So PGE atom in the org should look something like this.

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,590
Go ahead and select download.

00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,160
So you noticed you have various options here.

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:06,940
Go ahead and click here on Mac OSX and then get the latest version of PGE admin.

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
You'll notice you have some files to go ahead download the DMG file.

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,890
That's the PGR and files.

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,050
Go ahead and save that.

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm going to go ahead and jump to when it's done saving.

00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,760
And now that it's done it's go ahead and click on that file.

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,570
You'll get some license agreement.

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,490
Go ahead and agree to it and then you'll see it start working.

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,470
So once you have P.G. adamant three here what you're going to do is come down to Finder select new Finder

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,460
window.

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,240
And what you're going to do is take PGE adamant three and drag it into your applications and then let

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,550
it go there.

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,820
Once you've done that and you check your applications under your postgresql 9.5 folder you should CPG

00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,300
adamant theory.

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,530
So then if you go ahead and double click that that should pop up.

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,910
And now you have the PGE admin 3 development environment.

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,910
So this is one of the main things we're going to be working in throughout the rest of the Course I'm

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,600
really working in a Windows environment.

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,000
So if you see me looking for files you will see a Windows Explorer you can just basically fall all of

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,130
the same actions in a Mac OS explore.

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,900
And what's really nice about PGE outman is it's basically going to let anyone they're using Windows

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,570
or Mac or Linux if you have PGE out of an available to you.

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,020
Everything is going to look the same.

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,060
So everything we're going to be learning about is going to be mpg absent.

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,520
So just keep that in mind.

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,650
OK.

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,630
So that's it for the basic installation.

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,730
What I encourage you to do now is check out how to restore a database in order to learn how to get all

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,830
the files and resources set up on your computer and have download the example database onto your computer

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,120
.

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,000
OK.

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,330
Thanks everyone and I will see the next lecture
