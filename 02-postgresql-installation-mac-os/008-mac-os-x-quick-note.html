            <p>Welcome to the Mac OS X Installation Lectures! A quick note, in the videos one of the download sites has changed slightly, and it gives you two options, an Interactive Installer option and a Graphical Installer Option. The EnterpriseDB option is actually a little easier to use, so select that one (which is the same as this link below):</p><p>http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#macosx<br></p><p>That is the link I show in the video. Alright! Coming up next is a video walkthrough of me going through the step by step process of installing everything!</p><p>Feel free to post questions to the QA forum or check out Lecture 4 FAQs for common questions.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Jose</p><p><br></p>
