            <h4>Overview of Section</h4>

<p>After this section you should feel comfortable Creating and Restoring Databases using pgAdmin and restoring Table schemas. Later on in the course we discuss how to perform creation operations directly through SQL syntax, but for now you should just take advantage of pgAdmin for these tasks. Remember, if you restart pgAdmin, you may need to double-click on your server icon (if there is a red x on it) in order to reconnect to the databases you've created.</p><p><em>Feel free to post a discussion question if anything was confusing to you.</em></p><p><strong>Now that we've got everything set-up with PostgreSQL let's begin learning basic SQL syntax!</strong></p><p><br></p>
