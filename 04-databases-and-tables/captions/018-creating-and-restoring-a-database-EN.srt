00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello everyone and welcome to the creating and restoring a database lecture in this lecture we're going

00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,860
to do is create a base with the P.G. admin graphical user interface for UI console and then we're going

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,310
to restore a database and learn how to delete a database.

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,950
Something to note here is basically when we were installing the original DVD rental database we were

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,680
kind of doing it especially for the Windows installation through a very manual command line process

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:31,940
.

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,160
We're going to do now show you how you would actually probably do this if you were implementing post

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,300
sequel at work.

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,450
You would just use the PGE admin Council and save yourself a lot of time.

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,080
So let's go ahead and jump to the PGI item and console.

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,410
OK.

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,350
So I'm here at the PGE adamant console and what I have is DVD rental and postscripts remember a DVD

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,930
rental was our first installation of the sample database.

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,860
We're going to do now show you how you can do it basically much quicker and much simpler using the PGE

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:13,530
oddment 3 console which again is on databases right click and select menu database and then go ahead

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,560
and name your database.

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,880
We'll call this DVD to then click OK.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,050
Now you'll notice that we have the DVD to database created for us member last time we had a use a sequel

00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,170
query and we said create space database and then the name of the database of a semi-colon.

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,330
Here we just did it by the right click with the GeoEye console.

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,480
So just to show you a reminder of how we did it last time member I selected postscripts and then I selected

00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,440
sequel to execute a sequel query brought up my sequel editor and the way you would do this in pure sequel

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,980
you would say creates database and the name of your database which you could say let's say test DVD

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,040
and then call semi colon and to let it know that stay on the line that's all you want to write.

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,010
And then we'll click Run quick return successfully.

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,050
This is exactly the last time.

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,810
And then on databases if we just hit refresh.

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,230
Now we have a new test DVD data database so it's up to you what you prefer.

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,050
I would imagine most people just like the right click of creating a database so let's go over how to

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,080
delete a database we'll do the test DVD right now.

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:42,000
The most convenient way to do it using PGE admin is right click select Delete drop and then we'll go

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,430
ahead and just drop that database.

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,190
All right.

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,660
So we have DVD rental and DVD to DVD rentals already filled.

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:58,500
We go to schemers and public Inori has the tables for the actual database which we did in a very manual

00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,110
way.

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,730
Now let's see if we can do that in a little bit of a nicer way to DVD too.

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,810
So if we look at the schemas the public schemas for really DVD to notice we don't have any tables or

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,060
anything right now so because we haven't actually populated this database with any information.

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,170
So let's go ahead and use PGE admen in order to do that.

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:28,700
What you're going to do is go ahead and Right-Click DVD 2 and go ahead and click restore.

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,200
So restore is going to allow us to actually search for that tar file.

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,960
So if you click these three dots you'll get a pop up if you remember from the Windows installation video

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,570
for the DVD rental database.

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,630
I had my tar file in this folder under computer OAC Program Files postscripts sequel.

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,920
You may still have it under the downloads folder but notice I don't actually see it.

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,610
I just see that nine point five folders.

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,200
So if you remember having that tar file over here the reason it's not showing up is because right now

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,280
we're exclusively looking for backup files.

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,540
So I don't want to say look for all files and now I can see that the tar file right there and I can

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,530
click open and then just click restore and it will take a little bit of time but it will restore everything

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,840
and basically fill out all those tables.

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,650
Select done.

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,880
Let's go ahead and then refresh DVD to database and I'll notice it has all the same tables as the original

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,810
DVD rental where we did this manually with the command line.

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,850
All right so now you know basically two ways of creating and restoring databases.

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,900
The first is the more manual way when we basically walk through the installation of DVD rental.

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,880
The second one is kind of the nicer way with the GeoEye.

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,250
So right clicking on database's say new databases once you've created the new database you can right

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,890
click and save restore.

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,270
OK.

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,550
So that's fully restoring a database of all the information well we're going to do.

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,820
Next is learn how to restore a database with just the table schema meaning we just want the tables and

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,110
everything set up all the relationships.

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,390
But you don't actually want the data information there.

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,750
That's a little bit trickier.

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,030
So we'll cover in the next lecture.

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,510
All right let's go ahead and do a quick review of what we just did.

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,960
OK.

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,460
So just a quick overview we learn how to create a database with PGE admin using the graphical user interface

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,250
specifically learn how to use it also restore a database and delete a database member just using a right

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,680
clicking and those dropdown menu.

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,310
So that makes it very easy.

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,010
So now you kind of have two ideas of how to create and restore databases.

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,290
I think you'll agree with me that the second one using the GeoEye is quite a bit easier.

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,620
I'll save you a lot of time.

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,020
Up next we're going to learn how to restore just the table schema so you can imagine that maybe you

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:06,660
are opening up a new DVD rental store so you want to restore a new database with all the same table

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,680
schema both no data because you're opening up a new DVD rental store and now you want to set up a database

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,580
have it empty so you can later on add stuff to it.

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,760
OK.

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,340
So that will be up in the next lecture.

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,250
Thanks and I'll see you there.
