00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on restoring a database table schema only.

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,790
So in this structure we're going to learn how to restore a database but with only the table schema and

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,010
the table schema is the table names and the data types step along in that table but doesn't actually

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,850
contain any data.

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,250
So there's actually a really common tasks that you should know well and the reason for that being is

00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,870
if you ever find yourself needing in a real world situation to put the database schema somewhere else

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,770
you don't want to actually copy over the data either because you're going to be filling it out with

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,710
new data or because you have privacy concerns where the information in that data in your original database

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,500
is private.

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,980
And if you're gonna copy that database schema over to a development server you don't actually want to

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,790
copy private user information into your new database.

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,410
So that's why this is actually such a common task and PGE Atman is actually going to make it really

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,190
easy.

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,430
So let's go ahead and jump to P.G. Addleman now.

00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,170
So I'm going to go ahead and get started by opening up PGE admen.

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,570
OK so hearing him at PGE admin terminal or window if you will.

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,860
And you'll notice I right now have three databases.

00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,090
Given the previous stuff that we set up I want to see two things in two different ways that you could

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,030
do the sort of restore.

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,270
One is to restore it into a database that already has the data.

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,800
So go ahead and expand DVD rental schemas public.

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,390
You'll notice that I have the 15 tables and if I were to click on one of these individual tables and

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,410
look over rows the estimates that there's about 200 rows there.

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,940
So there is actual data in this.

00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,630
And if you double click this you can then begin to explore the columns etc..

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:56,170
So this table excuse me this database of DVD rental has all the tables and that has all the data.

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,560
So keep that in mind.

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,350
Something to do first is create a new database so I can do that either through the command line or simply

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,420
by right clicking on databases and saying new database.

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,400
And I will name this data base.

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's just say only schema now will say okay let it go ahead and create that database.

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,550
All right so now I have my only schema database.

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,750
And you notice if I check the public schemas I don't have any tables here.

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:42,150
So what I'm going to do is to take full advantage of PGE admin here and right click and say restore

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,350
.

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,380
So this whole process should look familiar to you but since this is the first way when we restored and

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,400
created a full database I have my format equal to custom or tar and I have my file name which is that

00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,370
DVD rental that tar file.

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,880
So here's the link to where my file is.

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,270
Go ahead and make sure the file path towards yours is is correct.

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,310
Or you can click on these three dots to continue exploring.

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,310
So the caveat here being I don't actually want to copy the entire data.

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,880
I just want to copy the table schema.

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,000
So how do I do that.

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,410
I can go to restore options number one.

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,860
And you'll see here and there type of objects.

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,060
Ill say only schema and that's exactly what I want to do.

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,100
So I want to make sure I click that.

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,480
So I don't actually take in any of that data and if I click restore and wait a little bit while it works

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,010
you'll notice it says Process return X code zero meaning everything worked out.

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,580
If I click done we should hopefully we make sure we refresh this order and looks good.

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,140
You'll see I have tables here.

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,630
So under my only schema database I was able to restore those tables and let's make sure it actually

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,430
worked by selecting the actress table.

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:05,310
And now you'll notice I have zero rows so I've copied and restored all the table schema including the

00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,650
columns of the type set it's expecting.

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,390
But the actual data is no longer there.

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,160
So it has no rows of data.

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,230
It just has the table schema that it expects.

00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,690
Okay.

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,020
So that's how you would do that if you were creating a new database for that table schema only restore

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,690
.

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,950
Now let's say I wanted to restore onto an existing database that already had the data.

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,280
So for example my DVD rental database here I go to tables.

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,960
Remember if I check actor it already has 200 rows of that data.

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,030
So how could I restore this database that it only has the schema essentially just get rid of all that

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,030
data but keep the table schema.

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,750
Well I can do that in a really similar manner.

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,580
I right click DVD rental click restore.

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,840
Wait for it to load.

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,050
I'm going to restore it again from that tar file under restore options.

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,460
Number one I'm going to say only schema and this is where you have to remember the additional step.

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,500
If your database still contains data you're going to go to restore options.

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,680
Number two you know what you're going to do is say clean before restore.

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,670
And that's essentially just going to clean away any data that is currently in that database before you

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,660
restore it.

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,270
That way you don't accidentally retain the data and you only pass in the data schema or the table schema

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,490
excuse me.

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,800
So let's go ahead and restore this and make sure all worked.

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,490
Go ahead and give it some time.

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,000
Looks like it finished a slick done.

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,190
And now if I go ahead and refresh this DVD rental I go to all my tables.

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,660
I have all of them and if I check actor now you notice that the DVD rental database that previously

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,440
had all the data is now just containing that table schema.

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,130
So that relationship all the tables and the columns it's expecting with none of the actual rows of data

00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,990
.

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,590
All right.

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,730
Perfect.

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,010
So that's how you can restore a database with just the table schema and no data along with it.

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,040
All right everyone thanks and I will see you with the next lecture
