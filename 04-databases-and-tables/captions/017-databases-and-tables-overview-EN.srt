00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,820
Hello everyone and welcome to databases and tables in this section we're going to focus on creating

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,760
and restoring databases and make heavy use of PGE admin that graphical user interface or GeoEye that

00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,370
we previously installed Peachi admin is a great tool and it's going to save you a lot of time for these

00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,230
specific types of tasks.

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,230
Restoring a database or creating a new database etc. later on we're going to learn more about direct

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,640
sequel's syntax like selector.

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,950
Order by where that kind of thing.

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,080
So don't worry too much about focusing on the sequel syntax right now.

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,250
In this particular section we're just going to use PGE admen so that you feel comfortable in creating

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,600
and restoring databases.

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,370
In case you ever want to create a restore database to practice your sequel syntax queries later on.

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,680
So it's important that we get this down really well first before we actually move into the learning

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,710
style Rexx sequel syntax and programming queries out.

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,280
So don't worry that's all coming but we're going to focus right now on PGE admen see feel comfortable

00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,850
creating restoring databases with all that being said let's go ahead and get started.

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,860
I'll see you at the next lecture
