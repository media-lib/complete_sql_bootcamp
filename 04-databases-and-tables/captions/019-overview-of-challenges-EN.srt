00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,610
Hello everyone and welcome to the overview of challenges lecture.

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,140
So throughout this course you're going to be receiving challenges and these challenges are going to

00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,200
allow you to test your understanding of postscripts and basic and more advanced sequel commands as you

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,810
go throughout the course.

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,830
The basis of these challenge scenarios will be that you've just been hired as a sequel consultant for

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,470
a DVD rental store.

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,420
So that's going to be the basic background as we give you challenges throughout the course.

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,190
So as far as solutions to the challenges challenges are going to start off very simple and basically

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,490
be asking you to repeat what you just saw in the previous lecture.

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,470
So don't worry if you're finding challenges to be very very basic at the beginning because that's how

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,180
they are.

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,840
Later on you're going to be provided with solutions or walk through video solutions for the tougher

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,730
challenges.

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,510
So at first the challenges are going to start off simple and ask you to repeat what you just saw in

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,250
the previous lecture and there's not going to be a specific solution to that challenge because you can

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,800
just reference the previous lecture later on the as it challenges get harder you'll need to be provided

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,840
with the solutions at the next lecture after the challenge lecture or we'll have a whole walk through

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,790
video in case it's a very difficult challenge.

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,630
Keep in mind that challenges may show up unannounced.

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,970
So always be ready for them with all that being said I hope you enjoy these challenges.

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,180
And I really hope you do them.

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,420
They're going to be a great way for you to get a chance to test your understanding and test out your

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,910
sequel knowledge on the example database as we go along through the course.

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,800
OK.

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,610
With that all being said I will see you at the next lecture.

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,430
Thanks everyone.
