<p><strong>There is a lot to read here so I apologize, but it will help clear confusion of the two versions of pgAdmin 3 and 4 and how the course deals with them!</strong></p><p><strong>This course was filmed using the software pgAdmin 3, then later on pgAdmin 4 came out in beta. However it was buggy for a lot of students, so we decided to wait until it was more stable. There are still some bugs, but it is stable enough that we will show you how to install pgAdmin 4 with PostgreSQL 9.6 in the next lecture so you can use it for the course. </strong></p>









<p><strong>Fortunately the installation of pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL is essentially the same for both Mac OS and Windows Users, so you should be able to follow along with the next lecture, just make sure to set aside about 20-30 minutes to complete the set-up process. If you are using a Mac OS computer however, you may find pgAdmin 4 to be very buggy, in which case I recommend installing pgAdmin 3 and PostgreSQL 9.5, check out the special notes below.</strong></p>









<p><strong>Once you are done with this installation you can skip to Section 4</strong>. Sections 2 and 3 contain the old installation information, in case you are interested in that, but you should probably skip them so you don't get confused. Again, basically just follow along with the next lecture and you should be good to go and jump straight to section 4. Sometimes auto-play of lectures will make this confusing, so you should manually check out the curriculum tab to skip to section 4.</p>









<p>While pgAdmin 3 and 4 look different, all the functionality is essentially the same, and all your SQL code will be the same as well. The main difference is that in pgAdmin 4 the query button is a lightening rod (shown in Lecture 6) and in pgAdmin 3 the button looks like a magnifying glass.</p>

<h4>Special Notes for Mac OS users and pgAdmin 4 bugs: </h4>

<p>* pgAdmin 4 can be extremely buggy for Mac Users, while most Mac Users can get it working after a lot of workarounds,<strong> pgAdmin 3 is much more stable for Mac Users. I would recommend using pgAdmin 3 if you are a Mac User,</strong> you can find it here: <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macos.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macos.php</a> . Even though this site says pgAdmin 3 is no longer supported, it still works just fine. You can skip to the Mac Installation section of the curriculum to watch me go through pgAdmin 3 installation. </p><p>If you do want to continue with pgAdmin 4 on a Mac, here are some trouble-shooting tips:</p>





<p>* Some Mac users will encounter a bug not allowing them to find the dvdrental.tar file. If you encounter this issue, check out the advice here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39796268/errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-when-trying-to-backup-a-database-in-pgadmi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39796268/errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-when-trying-to-backup-a-database-in-pgadmi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39796268/errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-when-trying-to-backup-a-database-in-pgadmi</a></p>







<p>* One of the main points of advice on that page says to download an updated version of pgAdmin 4, which you can find here: <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macos4.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macos4.php</a> . I've also seen that actually downgrading to pgAdmin 4.0 fixes some issues.</p>





<p>* For some Mac users, when restoring the database, it may look to take a really long time (Longer than 30 seconds), if this happens to you, try restarting pgAdmin 4 and then clicking refresh the database, it should then be up and running.</p>





<p>* For some Mac users, the file path to the bin folder (mentioned in the install lecture) is under a hidden folder, try checking these locations for it (you'll need to display hidden folders to see this file as the <strong>usr</strong> folder is hidden):</p>





<p>Could it be under:</p>







<p><code>/usr/local/postgres</code> </p>







<p>or</p>





<p><code>/usr/local/var/postgres</code> </p>





<p>or</p>





<p><code>/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5</code> <br></p>
