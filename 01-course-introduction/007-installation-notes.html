            <p><strong>Check In (Please read this to know what section to jump to).</strong></p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>By now you should have been able to download postgresql, pgadmin, and restored the dvdrental.tar file (it was a resource in the previous lecture). If you were able to complete those steps as shown in the previous lecture then you are good to go!</p><p>The two sections that follow (Section 2 and Section 3) are the older installation videos for pgAdmin 3 andÂ postgresql 9.5. If you have everything working then you can skip those two and go straight two section 4. The reason I have left those older installation videos are because some people have issues with pgAdmin 4 and want to reference the older installation.</p><p><strong>Again, if you have everything working correctly, skip to section 4, section 2 and 3 are the pgAdmin 3 installation videos that are just there for reference just in case. I'll see you in the course!</strong></p><p>-Jose</p>
