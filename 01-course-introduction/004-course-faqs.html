            <h4>COURSE FAQS</h4>

<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">1. Where do I download PostgreSQL and pgAdmin?</strong></p>









<p>Check the installation lectures for installation walkthroughs and links!</p>









<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">2. Where can I find the answers for the challenges?</strong></p>









<p>The solutions for each challenge come immediately after each challenge. Note, many times they are presented as a slide to force the student to type out the solution manually instead of copying and pasting. Typing it out manually has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to learn SQL!</p>









<p><strong>3. How do I get my certificate? </strong></p>

<p><strong>4. I'm having trouble unzipping the .zip file, I get a bunch of .dat files but no .tar file. What do I do?</strong></p>





<p>You can download the .tar file directly from this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gn20a3o9r6qa0bz/dvdrental.tar?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dropbox Link.</a><br></p>



<p><strong>5. How can I download the slides?</strong></p>



<p>The PowerPoint Slides are not available for download, but check the resources for this FAQ lecture and you can download a PDF file containing notes and code that are in the slides.</p>

<p><strong>6. PgAdmin is asking me for a password but I don't know what it is, what do I do?</strong></p>

<p>Make sure to have installed PostgreSQL and PgAdmin exactly as shown in the video lecture, it should have prompted you for a password. If for some reason it did not, try using the default values, with postgres username and leaving password blank:</p>

<p><em>username: postgres</em></p>

<p><em>password: </em></p>

<p>If that does not work for you, try uninstalling PostgreSQL and PgAdmin (make sure to do a full uninstall) and reinstall the software exactly as shown in the video.</p>

I'm on a Mac and PgAdmin isn't finding the dvdrental.tar file and gives me an error.</strong><br></p><p>This is a bug for some earlier versions of pgAdmin 4, check out the next lecture for helpful links to fix this.</p>
