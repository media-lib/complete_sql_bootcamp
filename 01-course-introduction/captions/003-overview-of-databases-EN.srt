00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone and welcome to the database overview lecture.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
So in this lecture we're going to learn what are databases and why use databases.

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,820
And after we answer those two fundamental questions we'll get a sense of where this course fits in the

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,370
realm of things.

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,400
So let's turn off the basic definition database or systems that allow users to store and organize data

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,840
and they're useful when dealing of large amounts of data.

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,090
So you might be wondering what are the typical users look like who deal with databases while databases

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,290
actually have a wide variety of users.

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,720
These can include analysts such as a marketing analyst a business analyst or a sales or sales operation

00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,330
analyst or more technical people like data scientist software engineers or web developers.

00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,060
Basically anyone needing to deal data has a great use case to work for database.

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,430
So since most users have some familiarity with a spreadsheet software either Google Spreadsheets or

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,150
Microsoft Excel we're going to do is discuss the transition from going from spreadsheets to databases

00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,310
.

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,180
So it's good to discuss some use cases for spreadsheets versus use cases for databases and then leverage

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,860
that knowledge to better understand databases.

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,290
So spreadsheets are really good for a one time analysis or to quickly need to churn something out such

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,230
as in Excel and they work with reasonable data set sizes something that can excel or Google Spreadsheets

00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,910
can open up really easily.

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,010
Now what's really nice about spreadsheets is they allow the ability for untrained people to work with

00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,610
data.

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,790
So anyone can just double click an Excel file open it and work with it.

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,520
However they do have downsides where databases really shine.

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,340
So databases are really great for data integrity meaning you don't want to have someone be able to just

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,480
click on a cell and change the data.

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,360
Databases don't really allow for that.

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,000
And they can also handle massive amounts of data data sizes that would just basically make excel or

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Google Spreadsheets crash and they can also quickly combine different data sets something that might

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,200
be difficult to do for larger data sets in a spreadsheet.

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,700
They also are perfect for automating steps for reuse due to the school syntax which will learn about

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,960
later and they can also support data for Web sites and applications.

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,440
So most Web sites and web applications or mobile applications are linked to some sort of database to

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,410
store their data and retrieve their data.

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,950
So let's go in and leverage that knowledge from spreadsheets to understand databases and see the similarities

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,280
between them.

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,330
So here we have a picture of a looks like a normal spreadsheet.

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,510
Here we have the columns.

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,630
It's just the basic glucose tracking spreadsheet.

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,840
And we have columns which just time some measurements etc. and various rows with different data points

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:51,910
.

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,570
And then at the bottom here we have tabs which are referencing various sheets in the spreadsheet software

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,270
here using Excel.

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,940
So we're transitioning from a spreadsheet to a database.

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,780
We can think of databases tables as the tabs of a spreadsheet system.

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,010
Each of those tabs of the spreadsheet handles various types of data or different rows in different columns

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,520
.

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:23,730
Those tabs will translate to tables in a database so that a database is made up of many tables and then

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:32,580
those tables are made up of rows and columns so the columns in the Table of a database is basically

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,780
exactly what you would think as a column in a spreadsheet.

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,310
It's just a vertical column that denotes a certain data type.

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,100
So for instance the first one here we have time.

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,880
Second we only have measurements so columns and spreadsheets are basically the same as columns in the

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,280
Table of a database.

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,680
And then the other feature we have from a spreadsheet to a database is going to be rows and rows again

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,060
behave exactly like you would expect them to in the database table.

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,240
They're just the actual row of all that data for a certain data point.

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,650
So in this case we're highlighting the data points seven eight and nine and then all the measurements

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,230
for those columns.

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,680
So again databases and sort of tabs they're going to have tables and those tables are also going to

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,900
have rows and columns and you can basically just imagine them as spreadsheets just much larger that

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,470
you can't individually click on.

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,190
OK.

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,540
So again we have columns rows and a set of tabs we're going to have tables.

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,170
So what are database platform options.

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,420
Well there's actually lots of database platform options a lot more than what I put here.

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,400
But here are some of the main ones you have postgresql sequel things such as my sequel and my sequel

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,330
server express Microsoft Access and then sequel lite.

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,760
Each of these has their pros and cons but we're going to be focusing on postgresql sequel.

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,130
The reason for this is because postscripts sequel is free open source.

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,830
It's widely used on the Internet.

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,770
It's multi-platform So meaning if you have various operating systems like Windows or Mac users you can

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,290
all use postscripts sequel and one of my main reasons for choosing it is that it's super easy to install

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,530
and just hit the ground running.

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,230
So post-career sequel's a great database choice for learning how to use sequel and sequel's a structured

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,290
query language that's what it stands for and that's what we're going to learn in this course.

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,220
Sequel is going to be the way we communicate for database.

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,530
So we were going to be able to communicate database to get data out of it or put data into it.

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,230
And the sequel learn this course can be applied to a variety of databases or siecle based software.

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,570
So we're not going to pigeonhole ourselves that just postscripts sequel what you learn in this course

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,470
you're going to be able to apply it to a variety of databases or software that uses sequel.

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,700
So for example of what a general sequel syntax would look like it would look something like this selects

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,170
some column names from a table and then you have some functions or clauses you're ordering by the first

00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,690
name.

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,220
So we're going to learn how to write a new sequel syntax like this in this course.

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,610
So sequel is actually useful for a lot of things.

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,960
Everything I've listed here runs on some sort of syntax of sequel so you have postscripts sequel or

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,980
my sequel or Oracle databases Microsoft Access to the basic databases you would think of that can use

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,030
sequel but there's also a lot of software out there that use a sequel as a way of interacting for data

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,690
such as looker or periscope data.

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:35,040
And there's also some abstractions that run on top of big data systems such as Hadoop and you can use

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,040
sequel with hive or Google's big queery or Facebook's presto which is basically using sequel to run

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,570
on top of very large data systems that use distributed data.

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:53,790
So sequel going to be incredibly useful to operate a variety of tools and databases with.

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,500
So you're also going to be notified if any of the sequel commands we learn in this course are specific

00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,230
to the post.

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,300
Gress sequel environment.

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,400
Most of the commands we learn are actually just going to be general sequel so you won't get too many

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
of these notifications.

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,180
Basically everything you learn here you're going to be able to apply directly to any conventional sequel

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,650
database.

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,290
OK let's go to review what we learned.

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,270
We learn what a database is why we should use a database.

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,410
We learned about the various sequel options and we also learned how to use sequel's skills in this course

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,470
and how we're going to be able to apply them to many other software programs.

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,230
OK.

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,530
But that being said let's go at and continue and learn some more.

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,450
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
