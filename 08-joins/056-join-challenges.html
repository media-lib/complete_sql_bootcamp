            <p>A quick note on the JOIN Section, there are no direct challenges aside from the examples shown in the course because JOINS will be heavily covered in the second assessment test. There are a few more advanced SQL features we need to learn before taking the assessment!</p><p>So just hang on a bit longer, after we cover some advanced topics in the next section you will get several challenges that really bring everything you've learned so far together!</p><p><strong>Thanks and I'll see you in the next section - Advanced SQLÂ Commands!</strong></p>
