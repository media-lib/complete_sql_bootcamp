00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello everyone and welcome to the overview of join types.

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,620
Lecture this lecture is going to begin to help build our understanding of the various different types

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,520
of JOINs of vailable to us in sequel and just a quick note.

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,610
This presentation is a resource for you in this lecture.

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,530
So if you go ahead and click that button that says extra resources or check resources for this lecture

00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,280
this PowerPoint is available to you.

00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,780
So as we learn more about the different types of joints it's going to become really useful to reference

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,160
Joines as a Venn diagram figure.

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,840
So these are actually really easy to find via a Google image search.

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,500
So if you just go to Google and then click on images and search for sequela joints that's Eskew L-Space

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,230
joins you should be able to find a diagram that looks really similar to this one.

00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,620
In fact most of the results will actually be the specific diagram.

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,450
What's really nice about this diagram is it shows the sequel joints as Venn diagrams and this really

00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,310
helps your understanding of what you're going to receive back when you do specific joins.

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,290
Now this one here in the middle this inner join is the one we just learned about and it's the most common

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,200
join but one hour we're going to do is expand our understanding to the rest of these joint types and

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,450
below each of these Venn diagram figures you're dealing with two tables and B and then you have the

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,650
actual sequence period.

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,840
And what it would return based on the Venn diagram.

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,020
OK.

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,340
So in order to discuss the various types of joints that are available to us what we're going to do is

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,260
use some example tables.

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,990
So in this case we have two example tables table A and table.

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,030
So table is on the left Table B is on the right.

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,270
And when you're using sequel and joins left and right are going to signify what you use select from

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,790
first versus what you're joining on them.

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,820
So the left in this case table A is going to be used as select columns from a.

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,340
And that's going to be the left table and then you're going to say joint on the right table which will

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,550
be Table B.

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,220
So if we look at right now what table in Table B have they both have two fields to them ID and name

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,700
.

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,650
So if we look at these two tables in combination we actually have essentially four unique columns a

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,930
id a name b ID and B that name.

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,880
So keep that in mind as we look through the various examples of Joines.

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,630
So something else to note here is that and these two original tables we have some items that are present

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,060
in both tables.

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,580
So throughout the various joint examples we're going to be joining based off the name column.

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,170
So if we take a look at table.

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,790
We have four rows with four names.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,090
Pirate monkey ninja and spaghetti and if we look at Table B The name's pirate and ninja are in both

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,540
tables so those are marked read in Table B the names Rootabaga And later are only in table B.

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,180
So that's important to keep in mind and we'll have an image of these original tables throughout the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,910
examples of the various joint types.

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,160
So let's go ahead and review the inner join the join that we just learn about.

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,910
So to put it a little more formally inner join produces only the set of records that match in both Table

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,970
A and Table B.

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,070
So if we look at our original tables left as on table a right is Table B.

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:32,160
We're going to say select all columns from table a inner join with two table B on the table a thought

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Name column equal to Table B that name column.

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,680
And what that is going to return is the a id a name and the B ID and the B name.

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,070
And you'll notice here the only things that are returned is where there was a match for that column

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,250
in both A and B.

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,360
So in this case there's only two rows in the tables that match all the Name column that's going to be

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,450
pirates and Ninja.

00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:03,690
So we have a thought Id say that name and B that ID and B that name as returns only where there was

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,800
a match in both tables so pirate and Inja and we could see that here from the Venn diagram.

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,300
So here the Venn diagram is going to fill in or highlight what's actually return.

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,490
And in this case if an inner join and a quick reminder You can also just type in join and it will automatically

00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,070
do an inner join.

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,920
So an inner join again produces only the set a record that match in both Table A and Table B.

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,900
OK so let's go ahead and explore a different type of join a fool outer join with a full outer join does

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:35,990
.

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,790
It's going to produce the set of all records in table A and Table B with matching records from both

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,380
sides where available.

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,260
If there is no match the missing side will contain a null.

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,500
So again this is important to know that the full outer join produces the set of all records and table

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,540
and table B with matching records from both sides where they're available.

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,900
And if there is no match where the missing sides are going to contain a null So basically you're going

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,090
to try to return everything from both tables and if there wasn't a match you're just going to put in

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,340
a null meaning empty.

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,180
So again let's go ahead and look at our A and B tables.

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,750
So the only places where we have a match on pirate and Ninja.

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,850
So if we go ahead and look at the result.

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,400
So we're saying select all columns from table a with a full outer join on Table B meaning that's going

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,940
to be returned the 8th that ID column A Name column B that ID column B the name column we're going to

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,170
get back the rows where there was a match.

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,040
So a pirate pirate ninja ninja and then for the rows where there is no match the side that was missing

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,460
is going to contain a null.

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,740
So here we have two Monkey No for spaghetti nil nil.

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,090
And then and this is what makes a full outer join unique.

00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,320
It goes ahead and takes it from the right table and puts in left table as nails as well.

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,570
So you have known all one Rootabaga normal three there later.

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,060
So again the full outer join produces the set of all records in table a table be with matching records

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,430
from both sides where they were available.

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,000
And if there was no match the missing side is going to contain the null.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,000
So we can show this through event diagram as basically returning absolutely everything and will have

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
nulls where we weren't able to find a match.

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,560
And that's known as a full outer join.

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,990
And again the syntax for that is just full outer join.

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,250
OK let's go ahead and move on to another joining syntax example.

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,150
And that's going to be the left outer join with the left outer join does is it produces a complete set

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,640
of records from table a with the matching records where they are available in Table B if there is no

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,050
match.

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,940
The right side will contain a null so we can basically think of this as a full outer join but we're

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,930
only confined to the left table.

00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,230
In this case table a.

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,270
That first table that you're actually saying from 2.

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,840
So we're saying select all columns from table a left outer join table B on the name columns.

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:14,780
So that's going to guarantee that you get all the rows from table a for the column you're specifying

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,980
the match on.

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,160
And if there was a match with table B we go ahead and fill it in and if there wasn't we fill it in with

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,100
null.

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,190
The difference here between a left outer join and a full outer join is that we don't return results

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,480
where there was there would be a null value in table.

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,490
So notice here.

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,120
Table B then is empty in this Venn diagram.

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,360
So if we go in and go back the difference here in the full outer join would have been these last two

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,950
rows where we go ahead and return the full records from both Table A and Table B in the case of a left

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,090
outer join.

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,770
We're only producing the complete set of records from table a where there was a match and then we check

00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,810
there was a match available in table B.

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,430
And if there was the match we went to clonal.

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,480
OK.

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,030
So again go ahead it's possible you maybe rewind or check the sequel Venn diagram charts and really

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,040
make sure you understand the difference between a full outer join and that left outer join and the critical

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,310
part is really these two bottom rows of the full outer join and make sure you understand the reasoning

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,870
of why these are present on the full outer join but that they're not present on the left outer join

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,440
.

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,110
OK.

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,300
Now something I want to discuss is there's also a right outer joins.

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,840
And that's basically going to be the exact same thing except in this case instead of highlighting here

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,340
table a will highlight table B where they match and we'll see some examples of that later on.

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,100
But let's go in and go with left outer join with a where statements and you might see this commonly

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,910
used.

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,010
But this allows you to produce the set of records only in table A but not in table B.

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,760
You're going to perform that same left outer join then exclude the records.

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,600
We don't want.

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,570
From the right side via a where clause.

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,840
So I'm going to show you how this is working.

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:16,550
So if we look at this table a here imagine that we only wanted to get in return the rows monkey and

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,660
spaghetti meaning we only want to produce a set of records that are in table A.

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,060
But not present in table B.

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,360
In that case you can use a left outer join with a where statement to check if records are null.

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,540
So you will go ahead and exclude the wrecker's you don't want from the right side via a where statements

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,340
or where clause.

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,490
So the syntax is this.

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,630
I'm going to say select all the columns from table a buffet left outer join on Table B.

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,220
Where we going on table a thought name equal to table B that name.

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:58,300
And then here's the specific part where we say where table be the ID is null meaning where the idea

00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,000
was no.

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
So there was no match on the names there.

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,670
And that basically returns the set of records only in table A but not in table B.

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,300
And this is what this Venn diagram is trying to show here.

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,700
So the records that are only in table A but not in table B.

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,800
So in this case it's going to be munky and spaghetti.

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,180
And again if you wanted to do this the other way around meaning only records in table B but not in table

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,720
A.

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,730
You could have said right outer join again with the WHERE clause there and that would have been only

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,010
on Table B if you said on the right.

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,800
So go ahead and reference that original sequel joint diagram because you can basically think of left

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,980
and right statements as just symmetrical to each other basting one table off the other.

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,650
And the reason they're symmetrical is because you could also just change the order and instead of saying

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,840
Right you could just change this wherever you see table a change table B.

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,360
So that's really a matter of preference there whether you like to use both left outer joins and right

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:05,130
outer joins or you just like to only use left outer joints and specify table orders yourselves.

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,760
OK let's go in and move on to a full outer join with a where clause.

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,860
So imagine you wanted to produce a set of records unique to table A and Table B you can perform the

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,040
same flawed or join and then exclude the records we don't want.

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,230
From both sides via a WHERE clause.

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,000
So with this specific query which you're going to return is only the wrecker's unique to table a table

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
B.

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,060
So basically are the records where they don't match up.

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,690
So in this case we don't want pirate or a ninja.

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,290
And the way you do that is with water Joyal whole where clause.

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:49,850
So we're going to say select all columns from table a full outer join table be on table a that name

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:57,710
column equal the table be that name column where Table 8 that ID is NULL for a table B that ID is null

00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:57,970
.

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,120
And what we're going to see back here is monkey spaghetti.

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,770
Those are unique to table a.

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,130
And then Rootabaga in there later and those are unique to table B.

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,450
And then the other columns are fields for that specific row are filled in all final statements.

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,260
OK.

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,200
So just a quick review we've learned about the various join types in the next couple of lectures we're

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,690
going to focus on showing you examples of these various joint types.

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,120
So we already walk through a bunch of examples of inner join the next couple extra we're going to do

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,170
is to show you some basic examples of the left outer join our full outer join just to build our understanding

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,150
of the various join types and see them in action.
