00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,620
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture video for the sample database installation.

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,270
Walk through this lecture is going to be walking you through how to download and install the database

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,550
that we're going to be using throughout the course.

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,780
First thing you should know is in the previous lecture it was just an article and had the resource on

00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,780
where to actually download the files so if you go to the previous lecture and check the resources for

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,280
that lecture you'll notice there was two files to download.

00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:38,100
One was a PMG file and the other was a zip file that PMG file is just a picture diagram of what the

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,890
database looks like and the DVD rental that zip files the important one that contains the actual database

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,650
and that's from the previous lectures.

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,080
So go ahead and check that out.

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,110
You should have downloaded it and keep track of the actual file path where you downloaded it to.

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,820
Next thing you want to know is if you're just a beginner in the program before then you definitely just

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,340
want to watch this video in its entirety first and then go back and implement the instructions as you

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,920
watch it a second time.

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,990
There's going to be a few key commands that are a little complicated.

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,660
Nothing too crazy but it might be better if you're just a beginner to watch the entire video first and

00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,650
then go back a second time to follow along as you implement the instructions.

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,240
Last thing will cover all the commands you see in this lecture and future lectures so don't worry about

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,270
fully memorizing all the commands as we type them out.

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,880
So for instance there may be a command where I say select everything from a certain table.

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,530
Don't worry about memorizing that or learning it.

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840
That's just to check if the installation of work.

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,640
So all the commands you're going to see in this lecture are just to check if everything's installed

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,110
and working correctly.

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,950
Again that goes for the command lines and the sequel prompts so don't worry about those We're going

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,160
to cover everything in future lectures.

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,930
Everything you see here in this particular lecture you have to type out and copy it exactly as I'm putting

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,530
it in.

00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,000
But don't worry about memorizing those particular commands because we'll go over everything later on

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,010
in the future.

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,070
OK.

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,750
With that being said I want to go ahead and jump to a browser real quick so I can give you a little

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,040
bit of background on the actual database we're using for this course.

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,510
All right.

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:26,580
So I wanted to show you was the Wikipedia or Wiki for the postgresql sequel sofrito wiki that post gresse

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,130
sequel dot org slash wiki slash sample underscore databases.

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,940
You'll have this sample databases page and the one we're using is based off of my sequel's classic database

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,630
which is called Sakia.

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,670
But for postscripts they renamed that to Gila.

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,650
So just keep that in mind.

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,990
And the reason we're choosing it is because this is probably by far the most common sample database

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,760
to use when instructing someone about sequel commands or any particular syntax of sequel or particular

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,630
database which uses sequel.

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,170
So that's why we're using it that way you can use these skills and immediately just quickly transfer

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,680
them to any other tutorials that use the Akila database which is by far the most common database used

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,270
.

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,560
So it's an extremely famous database.

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,780
It's inspired by DVD store.

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:27,150
So if you went ahead and downloaded the PMG file from the previous lecture you'll notice you have this

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,200
picture and this image essentially shows what the database actually looks like as far as relationships

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,980
and its various tables.

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,460
So we'll go over everything later on and tackle these tables one by one as we begin to learn the sequel

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,280
commands.

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,790
But just keep in mind if you ever need an overview of all the tables are what's actually going on from

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,020
a bird's eye view of the entire database.

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,540
You can reference that pinchy file.

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,180
OK.

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,150
So once you get more advanced with sequel and postgresql sequel you can check out these other sample

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,580
databases to play around with.

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,220
All right.

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,350
So we have our DVD rental that zip file downloaded and you have your top PNB file downloaded what you're

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,550
going to do is go ahead and go to the location where you saved that zip file.

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,070
OK.

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,810
So I went ahead and jumped to the location where I saved it.

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,390
You'll notice it was a compressed zip file here.

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:32,760
So you had to do was right click this and either use 7 zip or when rar whatever your extraction program

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,000
is.

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,470
Go ahead and extract it all here.

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,520
And then you should either end up with a winner or file or some tar file.

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,820
But you should have extracted it to some other file.

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,340
But you want to do is go ahead and remember where ever you saved it what the path to that file was.

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,950
So if you're in Windows you can go up here and if you click it you'll see a path here.

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,950
So here it's C program files postgresql.

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,530
So yours would probably be straight in downloads.

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,540
If you didn't move it anywhere but I move mine to postscripts sequel so you can go in and follow this

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,540
if you want.

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,450
But after unzipping it now I have my tar file and I know it's full file path location that's going to

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,610
be important because we'll reference this later on when we tell postscripts where it actually assembled

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,930
a database from.

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
OK.

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,350
So we've done so far as you've downloaded the DVD rental that's it and you unzipped it and gotten the

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,690
tar file out or some sort of when rar file.

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,850
So you've answered it and you're ready to go.

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,210
Next thing you're going to want to do is go ahead and open up PGE adamant.

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:49,060
So go ahead and search for it so I'll search for PGE admen and then I'll go ahead and open it up.

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,660
All right.

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,880
So now I have PGE outman and it looks a little something like this.

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,990
Notice we don't have many commands available to us because we haven't really started anything.

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,510
So the next thing I want you to do is go ahead and check it out.

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,040
You have postscripts sequel whatever version you downloaded and the local hosts should match what you

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,300
had during the installation.

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,020
So in our case it was 5 4 3 2 which was the default.

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,460
And if you go ahead and wups click on that you'll notice you have some properties start showing up and

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,860
you actually get some abilities here on the toolbar.

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,220
So that's a single click.

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,560
What I wanted to do now is go ahead and double click and then enter the password that you put in would

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,340
remember that was your super user password that try to memorize.

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,990
You can go in and store the password in case you don't want to have to worry about it later on.

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,440
And then click OK we'll give you a warning about saving passwords.

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,150
If you're the only one operating on the computer that's totally fine.

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,070
And so this is the toy database you should be totally fine.

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,730
All right.

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,140
So you went ahead to use your super user password and we'll talk about super users later on.

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,990
But that was the password that you had during the installation process so put it in there just go ahead

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,630
and check off that it remembers it.

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,940
So you know to constantly be putting it in and you'll see you have a tab on databases and you'll see

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,300
post graphs and you also have table spaces and log in rolls.

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,170
So continue along with this next thing you want to do is double click Post postscripts and you'll see

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,340
it expand.

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,070
You'll have catalogs event triggers extensions schemas and if you expand schemas you'll see public and

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:36,180
if you expand public let's go ahead and make this a little bigger so you can view everything.

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,910
You'll notice you start having tables trigger functions views etc..

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,580
So eventually want to do as we finished the database installation process is essentially fill out this

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,760
with the DVD rental tables that we saw in that image.

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,420
So right now everything 0 which makes sense because we haven't actually create anything or populating

00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,700
anything.

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,190
Next thing you're going to want to do is go ahead and open your command prompts if you go to search

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,670
and say C and D.

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,170
This is your command prompts.

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,470
So you go ahead and open it up and it should look something like this.

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,190
Now that we have a command prompt open the next thing we're going to do is change the directory of the

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,230
command prompt to the bin folder of postscripts sequel.

00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:31,750
So by jump back here and go to postscripts sequel and click 9.5 bin.

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,990
So this is where I want to be in my command prompt So this is the path I want see Program Files postscripts

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,170
sequel 9.5 bin and it should look really similar for you.

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,670
Maybe a different version 9.6 for using this in the future et cetera.

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,840
So going to go ahead and copy that.

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,540
So again just keep that in mind.

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,800
That's exactly what we're going to do right now as far as the command line where we're going to change

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,640
to or the directory change to at the command line.

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,430
So if I go ahead and bring back my command line what I'm going to type in is CD D and that stands for

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,340
change directory.

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,320
So right now if you notice if I just take that out I'm just under users in my user name going to CD

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,400
to change their rectory and then go ahead and copy that line that you just had as far as the directory

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,530
to the benefit.

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,900
And you'll notice if I just showed you but if I do control Viets to paste it's not going to work.

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,280
So you're going to want to do is right click and then do paste.

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,580
All right then click enter and now your command line is that the.

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,630
Been file.

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,270
So again what you're going to do is check up here.

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:52,300
Go to see Program Files postscripts sequel 9.5 slash been know where that directory is and then go to

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:59,050
your command line and at your command line what you're going to do is type CD for change the rectory

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,750
and then right click and paste in that entire file path OK.

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,800
So just to review I've done so far.

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,860
You've downloaded that zip file.

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,120
You went ahead and unzip it.

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,850
Now you have a winner or tar file and then you went ahead.

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:24,350
Open up your command prompt with ACMD and then you change directory using CD to that Ben file of postscripts

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,270
sequel.

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,200
All right.

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,560
Next are going to do is hop back to PGE admen.

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,470
OK so here I am at PGE Addleman.

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,510
And what we're gonna do is if you just collapse all this post gresse so selecting post gress.

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,900
Go ahead and click on here which is execute arbitrary sequel queries.

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,450
Click that and you should get another window pop up that looks something like this.

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,740
Let me go and expand it.

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,480
So it looks a little cleaner.

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,710
So there you have this and what you're going to do is give a very basic sequel query and we'll go over

00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,740
these exact queries later on.

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,920
But for now just go ahead and copy exactly as I type and what I'm going to do is say creates

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,430
database

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,450
DVD rental semi colon and that's it.

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,180
And then I'm going to go ahead and click here to execute the query.

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,760
And then once it's done executing You should see queery return successfully with no result in some amount

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,540
of time.

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,490
So that makes sense.

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,170
It should return no results because right now all this is doing is creating the database.

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,630
And just to reiterate we will go over all these commands later on before right now just go ahead and

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,150
copy exactly as I'm typing.

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,770
To fully install everything so we just create space database DVD rental semi colon and then go ahead

00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,450
and run and execute that query.

00:11:59,370 --> 00:11:59,750
OK.

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,150
So once you've run that go ahead and minimize that.

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:13,010
And if we go back here to databases or your PGE admin go ahead and click refresh.

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,390
And after you refresh that you should see your DVD rental database.

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:25,410
Now keep in mind you should have clicked and highlighted database and then click refresh if you just

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,790
highlight post gresse and click refresh.

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,640
Nothing happened.

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:34,160
So click databases and refresh and you should see the DVD rental database.

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,590
And if you expand it you'll see schemas public and again right now we have no tables or anything.

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,260
So basically what we just did was created an empty database that has not been populated yet.

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,400
The information that we're going to populate it with is contained in that zip file that we unzipped

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:57,510
earlier but so far all we've done is just you executed that sequel query which was create space database

00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,040
DVD rental.

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,250
So I call and then you went back to P.G. admen.

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,660
So just go ahead and minimize that.

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,510
Go back to PGE admin click on database's click refresh and once you've done that you should see that

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,480
DVD rental.

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,320
They'll have a little X on it basically meaning that there's nothing there yet you haven't clicked that

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,140
yet.

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,970
OK so now we've got to do is populate this.

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,570
All right.

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:32,160
So now the trickiest part that we're going to do is actually populate this with some tables.

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,040
So go ahead and go back to your command prompt.

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,530
I'll open it up right now and at your command prompt.

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,620
Remember you should be in Ben what you're going to do is basically type out exactly what I am typing

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:45,870
up.

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,230
You're going to say PGE underscore restore space.

00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,030
So that stands for postscripts restore.

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,950
So essentially what we're doing on a very basic level is restoring an old database.

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:09,870
Next thing we're going to do is specify a user or we're going to do that with Dash uppercase you post

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:18,400
so users postscripts another space go Dasch D which stands for database.

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,490
And we're going to Taipan DVD rental which was rumored that that was the database we just created using

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,850
that secret query.

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:32,120
And then finally what you have to do is put in the path of where your dot tar file is.

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,470
So let me go ahead and show you how to do that.

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,940
So if we go back to Windows Explorer here remember I have postscripts sequel.

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:49,620
I have this tar file so I can go ahead and do is if you want you can go to properties and it will give

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,850
you the location path.

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,920
So that's one way of doing it.

00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,700
Either way of doing it is if just click here.

00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,730
Remember you can always use edit copy.

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:00,650
OK.

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,860
So I have that.

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,570
So I know where my tar file is going to go and go back to my command prompt.

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,860
And now that I'm back on my command prompt what I'm going to do is paste.

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,450
So if you notice I have a dot dash DV The space DVD rental the file path and I'm just going to add to

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:33,320
it the DVD rental dock tar and I'm going to click enter.

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,420
All right so you probably noticed that I got an error here and this is a common error.

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,020
Ill say too many command line arguments.

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:46,490
And the reason for that is because of the space between program and files here.

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:54,300
So we're going to either put some escape characters in order to make the PGE underscore or restore operate

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,020
correctly.

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,710
If you're just in download slash DVD rental that tar you probably didn't get this error.

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,980
But the reason it shows is because if you accidentally or on purpose placed your tar file and zip file

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:14,200
into a file path that ended up having some spaces in there you may get some errors.

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,040
So to fix that what we're going to do is go ahead and put some escape characters for those spaces.

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm going to just go up on my keypad and that will restore all the lines that we just written out so

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,570
don't type them again.

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,910
And what I want to do is take care of this space here.

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,350
So one thing you could have done is a backslash escaped that particular character but we're going to

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:46,560
do instead it's a little easier is go ahead and just in case this whole thing in quotes.

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,300
So I put a double quote there and Wessling going to put a double quote at the end.

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,900
I'll click enter.

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,630
Now you notice it's actually running.

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,230
And there's no air.

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,020
So let me just go again and reiterate what we just did.

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,300
So I said PGE underscore restore space dash you for a user.

00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:16,920
So that's basically a minus sign that dash capital you space postscripts space minus the dash sign D

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,030
for the database.

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,130
Remember we created the DVD rental database and then you're going to go ahead and put in the file path

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,830
to your tar file if your file path.

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,160
A space in it.

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,010
So for example programs space files.

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,560
You'll get an error that will be too many command line arguments.

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,010
You won't get the error if you did everything correctly and just had to in downloads so ignore this

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,120
information if it's not applicable to you.

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,690
But if he did get the error you can either put an escape character here which is just a backslash before

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,510
files or the easier way to do it is just in case everything in either single quotes or double quotes

00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:01,380
so that entire file path here put a double quote for C double quote after tar.

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,530
Then click enter and everything should work.

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:11,700
So now if you go back to PGE admen and click refresh on DVD rental boom you'll notice.

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,410
Now we have our tables here.

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:21,630
But the actor the address the category city etc. We have our views trigger functions and functions.

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,730
So I know that was kind of a long and complicated process.

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,600
So let's go ahead and just review everything we did.

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:30,920
All right.

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,940
So for a very quick overview of everything we just did.

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:40,070
You had to download the zip file for DVD rental extract the tar file from DVD rental.

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,110
That's it.

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,810
Open up P.G. Aardman and then go run that query that we showed which was create database DVD rental

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:46,980
.

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,920
So Michael and then you had to open your command prompt you could do that by searching CNID you to use

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,590
CD to change the victory to the postscripts bin folder like we showed and then you had to use the command

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:06,120
PGE underscore restore that you postscripts the DVD rental and then encapsulate and quotes the file

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,090
path to your doctor file.

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:08,960
All right.

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,130
So I know that was really complicated and we kind of did a lot there.

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,520
I promise it will get a lot easier in the future and we'll see much better ways of doing and creating

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,770
the database and restoring databases from a particular source.

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:28,680
But this was just the very basics as far as just getting everything installed and ready to go.

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,350
We actually learn how to do all of this in a much better fashion in a couple lectures in the future

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,640
.

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,220
Okay thanks.

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,240
And feel free to ask any discussion questions in the forums in case you're lost or get stuck in any

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,330
steps.

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,260
Okay thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
