00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,170
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on the windows.

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,770
Post sequel installation.

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,800
First thing you're going to want to do is go ahead and open a web browser and go to w w w post gress

00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,400
sequel dot org.

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,530
So let me go ahead and jump to my web browser so I can show you what this looks like.

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,930
Ok so I'm at my web browser now and something I wanted to point out is you can actually just google

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,600
search postscripts sequel and the very first thing that will pop up as far as non ad links is going

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,190
to be post gresse sequel.

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,110
So go ahead and click that link and it should take you to a page that looks like this.

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,120
And then the next thing you're going to do is go ahead and go to download.

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,390
And once that's loaded you'll see postgresql sequel court distribution and you'll see some prebuilt

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,330
packages which are going to do is click on Windows and then you're going to go ahead and download the

00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,380
graphical installer.

00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,450
And what this is going to do is going to really make the process of installing super straightforward

00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,690
and it's actually very quick and fast and it's also going install a very important graphical tool called

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
PGE admen three.

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,960
So let's go ahead and click download here and I'll take you to a new page.

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,700
Go ahead and not register and what you're going to do is go ahead depending on your computer download

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,750
the latest version.

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,690
Right now it's nine point five point one for me.

00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,880
And depending on whether you have a 32 bit or 64 bit here in your computer is probably going to be 64

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,080
bit.

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,980
Go ahead and click the download that's appropriate for you click it and your download should begin shortly

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,310
and the pending browser using just see it.

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,950
Come over here.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,330
All right.

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,530
So go ahead and jump to the end of that download.

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,150
All right so I went ahead and jumped to the finished download.

00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,260
Go ahead and click on that executable file.

00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,520
Go ahead and say yes and you should have the graphical installer jump up.

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,250
OK.

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,950
There it is.

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,770
Let's go ahead and all you do is click next.

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,500
Save it if you want to whatever directory but I'm going to choose the default under program files.

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,490
PostgreSQL sequel.

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,060
Nine point five.

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,790
Go ahead and click next.

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,350
Go ahead and store your data under the Data folder.

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,900
That's fine too.

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,170
And this is the important part.

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,920
You're going to want to provide a password for a database.

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,300
Super User.

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,730
So we'll go over later on.

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,520
What a super user actually is.

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,020
But make sure you remember whatever password you type in here.

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,300
So let me go ahead and fill this out.

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,440
OK so I filled that out.

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,990
I'm going to go ahead and click next.

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,140
And go ahead and leave the default port.

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,160
It should probably be five four three two or a very similar number that is default.

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,270
Go ahead and leave this location for the database cluster's default.

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,330
And then now you're ready to begin installing so.

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,060
Go ahead and click next and you'll notice that actually installs very quickly.

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,030
Again make sure you're write down your super user password somewhere so you remember it will be going

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,640
over that later on what it actually means.

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:19,560
But basically you may need that password later on to access and create tables as a super user.

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,080
All right.

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,920
I'll go ahead and fast forward to this finishing.

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,300
So we're actually almost done that only it was a jump of about 20 seconds.

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,390
He should the whole process should only take up most just a few minutes.

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,620
You'll notice it's going to initialize the database cluster.

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,200
Say this may take a few minutes depending on the speed of a computer.

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,060
That speed may vary.

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,440
OK so once that's done initialising you'll notice he has a stack builder option.

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,330
Go ahead and just click that off.

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,720
You don't need it for this course and then just go ahead and say finish and that's it.

00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,440
All right.

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,370
In the next lecture I will show you how to load the sample data into your newly created Postgres sequel

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,810
installation.

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,030
Thanks everyone and I will see if the next lecture
