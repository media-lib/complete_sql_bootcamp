            <p>Check the resource for this lecture for the download file for the sample database for the course! This file is called <strong>dvdrental.zip</strong>. This is the file we will be referring to in the database set-up lecture. Make sure you have some way of unzipping a <strong>.zip </strong>file, such as a program like (WinRar or 7zip). There is also a<strong> .png </strong>file containing a figure of the schema of the Database. This is optional to download, but we recommend you download it anyways as a reference.</p>

<p>Alright! After downloading the zip file, check out the next lecture for a walkthrough on the set-up of the database!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note: If you are having trouble with the unzip steps, you can download the .tar file directly from this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gn20a3o9r6qa0bz/dvdrental.tar?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dropbox link.</a></strong></p><p><br></p>
