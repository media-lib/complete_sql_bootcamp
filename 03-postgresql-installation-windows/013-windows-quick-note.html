            <p>Welcome to the Windows Installation Lectures! A quick note, in the videos one of the download sites has changed slightly, and it gives you two options, an Interactive Installer option and a Graphical Installer Option. The EnterpriseDB option is actually a little easier to use, so select that one (which is the same as this link below):</p>

</p>

<p>That is the link I show in the video. Alright! Coming up next is a video walkthrough of me going through the step by step process of installing everything! If you have trouble with the command line install lecture, you can go ahead and skip to the "Creating and Restoring a Database" lecture, which does the exact same thing, but using a simpler graphical interface.</p>

<p>Feel free to post questions to the QA forum or check out Lecture 4 FAQs for common questions.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
