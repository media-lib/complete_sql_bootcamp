            <h4>Advanced SQL Commands</h4>

<p>In this section of the course we will go over a few topics that will be useful for you to know. These topics are:</p>





<ul><li>Mathematical Functions</li><li>Timestamps and the extract function</li><li>String Functions and Operators</li><li>SubQuery</li><li>Self-Join</li></ul>





<p>After these topics we will have our second assessment test! Once you've completed that assessment test the course will shift to learning how to create and insert information into tables and databases, instead of our previous focus on reading from databases! If all you needed to know was how to read from a SQL-like database interface, you should be good to go after completing the second assessment! However, it still may be useful for you to view some of the later topics such as table views.</p>





<p><strong>Congratulations on making it this far into the course! Let's keep learning!</strong></p>
