            <h4>Assessment Test 3</h4>

<p>Welcome to your final assessment test! This will test your knowledge of the previous section, focused on creating databases and table operations. This test will actually consist of a more open-ended assignment below:</p>













<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Complete the following task:</strong></p>













<p>Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">t</strong><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">eachers</strong> and <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">s</strong><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">tudents.</strong></p>













<p>The <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">students </strong>table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.</p>













<p>The <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">teachers </strong>table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,</p><p>homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.</p>













<p>The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:</p>













<ol><li> We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.</li><li> We must have ids as the primary key of the tables</li><li>Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.</li></ol>













<p>Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.</p>







<p>Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.</p>







<p><strong>Keep in mind that these insert tasks may effect your constraints!</strong></p>
