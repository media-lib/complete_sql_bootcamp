00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello everyone and welcome to the challenge lecture for the ORDER BY statement.

00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,980
So in this lecture you'll receive the challenge task and then in the next slide you'll get some hints

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,420
on how to solve it in the next slide you get the solution and I'll give you fair warning before we get

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,620
to the hints or solution slides for the challenge task.

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,240
OK.

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,490
Your first challenge is to get the customer ID numbers for the top 10 highest payment amounts.

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,910
OK.

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,890
Again just get the customer ID numbers for the top 10 highest payment amounts.

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,730
You may have to do some exploring to figure out what table is right for that sequel query.

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,130
All right.

00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,540
So go ahead impassivity now.

00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,010
All right.

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Coming up next is the hints for this challenge.

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,670
Moving on to the hints so hints you'll need to use the payments table and you also need to use order

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,380
buy in limit together to solve this.

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:59,760
And remember you can use A.S.C. or DGSE to get the desired results of YOUR ORDER BY statement so either

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,620
ascending or descending.

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,840
Just keep that in mind.

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,860
And coming up next is the solution to the challenge to go to impassivity enough you don't want to see

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,170
the solution yet.

00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,570
OK moving on to the solution.

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,390
So the solution looks something like this.

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:22,110
I said select customer id column and the Amount column from the payment table order by the amount in

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,300
descending order and limit 10.

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,150
If you just said ORDER BY amounts you would have gone in the wrong order in order to get the highest

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,900
payments you had to say descending order and limit 10 to only get the top 10 results.

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,300
And notice here I said customer id an amount column requested even though post-career sequel doesn't

00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,660
actually require you to say the amount column.

00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,870
If you're going to say ORDER BY amount you could have just said customer ID.

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,610
It's good practice to include the column name that you're ordering by.

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,880
So just keep that in mind.

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,470
That way the sequel syntax can be moved from any sort of sequel engine like Oracle sequel or my sequel

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,640
etc..

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,070
OK moving on to the next challenge the next challenge.

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,800
I want you to get the titles of the movies with film IDs 1 through 5 so just get the titles of the movies

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,270
with the film IDs 1 through 5.

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,420
So one two three four five.

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,540
OK.

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,270
Coming up next are the hits for this challenge to go in a positive if you don't want see the hints you're

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,990
living on.

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,520
OK the hints are you going to want to use the film table.

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,880
And again you'll need to use the order by and limit statements.

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,040
And again remember you can use a C or D A C to get desired results.

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,040
OK moving on to the solutions for this challenge.

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,500
The solution is select film Id title release year from film order by film.

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,580
Limit 5.

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,130
So again you actually didn't have to specify which columns you wanted since I just wanted the film Id

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,200
You didn't have to.

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,700
Well since I just wanted the title really you didn't have to actually call for release year but I just

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,840
did that to show a couple more columns.

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,180
Really all you had to say was select title from fill order by film Id.

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,800
I just put a few more columns in there so the query looks a little more fleshed out.

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,630
Again it's good practice to always include the column filt mighty that you're ordering by.

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,740
In this case it's film Id really was not an actual necessary column.

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,510
I just put that in there you should just see 2006 for all of them.

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,910
OK with that being said.

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
Great job everybody.

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,110
Let's go ahead and learn some more and I will see you in the next lecture.

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,770
Thanks everyone
