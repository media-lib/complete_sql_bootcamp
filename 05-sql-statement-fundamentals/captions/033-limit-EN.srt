00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,030
Hello everyone and welcome to the limit statement lecture.

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,520
So it's going to be a very quick lecture just to introduce the limits sequel query concept.

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,970
So limit allows you to limit the number of rows you get back after a query.

00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,220
It's really useful when you want to get all the columns but not all the rows.

00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,220
So usually pretty much always goes at the end of a query.

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,550
Best way to show this is just through a couple of quick examples.

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,980
So let's go ahead and jump over to the Peachi admin so we can see some examples of this.

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,520
OK so here I am at PGE admin what I'm going to do is just go ahead and select the DVD rental database

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,530
and then execute some arbitrary sequent queries.

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:50,130
So to show you a good use case for limit imagine you wanted to figure out what all the columns in for

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,760
example the customer table was.

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,580
You can say select Asterix from customer.

00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,860
So my colon run this.

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,990
Now if you're doing a really large database which are table or data set which is what you're usually

00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,080
going to be doing in this case is reasoning and sample data set.

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
It's only about 600 rows.

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,220
Five hundred ninety nine.

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,210
So it's not a big deal currently to return all of these rows but usually it is going to be a big deal

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,560
.

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:26,250
So in that case what you can do is go ahead and add limits at the very end of your query and then you

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,600
enter a number signifying how many rows you want back.

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,360
So in this case I'll say limit 5.

00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,530
And if I go ahead and run that query number.

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,300
EF 5 is the key or the hot key for running a query instead of having to click here execute query.

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,590
And so now I've limited that to just five rows and it returns the first five rows for that query.

00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,380
So there's two really good use cases for this one which will learn about later is when you order or

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,650
use ORDER BY.

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,550
So you can just grab like the top five or the first one when you order stuff and we'll learn about ORDER

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,330
BY in the next lecture.

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,910
And the other great use case for this is when you just want to figure out what all the columns were

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,880
for that particular table.

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,350
You can just say limit 5.

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,430
That way you return everything as far as the columns you're not returning the entire database so it

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,310
doesn't take a whole long time to execute a query.

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,470
So for example just limit one goes ahead and returns you this.

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,660
So again it's a pretty basic use case.

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,560
Just limit your keyword goes at the end.

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,890
So if you have other stuff go.

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,450
You would just go ahead and fill it in here.

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,840
So select a certain column from customer maybe have Sunwear statements etc..

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,450
And then at the very end of all these statements you just say limit and it limits your response to just

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,500
how many rows you specify.

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,840
OK.

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,530
There's that challenge for this because it's a pretty simple concept.

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,330
Again at the end of your query you can just say limit and then the number of rows you want back semi-colon

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,960
.

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,590
OK thanks everyone.

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,250
And then the next lecture we're going to learn about.

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,560
ORDER BY.

00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,070
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
