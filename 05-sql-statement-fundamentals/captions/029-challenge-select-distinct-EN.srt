00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,040
Hello everyone.

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,220
Welcome to the next challenge for you.

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,260
The Select Distinct challenge.

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,390
We're going to have an overview of the challenge.

00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,180
So what situation is the actual challenge itself in context of the sequel syntax and then some hints

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,400
and solution.

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,420
And as always I will warn you in the hints and the solutions are coming.

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,160
So is the situation we want to know the types of ratings movies can get in the United States.

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,790
So for example P.G. 13 rated r etc..

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,420
And we want to know which ones we have in our database.

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,210
So your challenge is to use a Select Distinct statement to get the distinct rating types our films can

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,220
have in our database.

00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,840
So for example you're going to use the select distinct statement in order to figure out do we have an

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,950
R rated movie in our database.

00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,580
How could you use a select statement to answer that question.

00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,500
So remember to click on the database.

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,030
So in this case that DVD rental database then select arbitrary secret query button to get to the sequel

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,280
editor.

00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,650
That being said Best of luck you can continue watching for hints in the solution.

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,200
All right.

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,270
So go ahead and puzzle video.

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,580
Now if you want to do a funny Hintz but I'm going to go to the Hintz lecture or slide now.

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,480
So a couple of hints you'll want to use the film table to do this and you can use select Asterix from

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,970
films semi-colon to get an idea of what columns to use to actually find the name of that column.

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,750
All right so those are your hints and a solution is coming up next.

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,460
So go ahead and positivity now if you want to try it on your own before seeing the solution.

00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
Ok so now let's go to the solution.

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,230
So the solutions actually quite simply want to say select the stinks rating.

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,440
So rating is the name of the column and it's from the film table so select distinct rating from film

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,470
.

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,260
So Michael.

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,940
And your sequel query.

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,390
OK hopefully you're able to figure that out on your own.

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,840
If not go ahead and review the Select Distinct lecture for a better background on how exactly to solve

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,070
the problem.

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,080
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
