00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on select this thing.

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,130
So this lecture we're going to get an overview of how to use Select Distinct keyword.

00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,330
It's going to be really useful for some common queries where you just want to remove duplicate.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,790
So let's go and discuss what select distinct looks like in its syntax and then we'll go through an example

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,140
.

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,250
So in a table a column may contain duplicate values so you can imagine if you had a table full of dates

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,370
you may have duplicate dates and you just really want to grab the stinks dates or maybe have a list

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,800
of films and you just want to grab the stinko films etc. so that the stink keyboard can be used to return

00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,330
only the stings or different values.

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,750
So let's go ahead and look at what the syntax for that would look like it's going to look like this

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:48,780
.

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,190
You'll say select space distinct and those are keywords so I put them in all caps.

00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,040
Then the column names you want to select separated by comma and then the save from the table name.

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,040
So let's go ahead and try this on an actual example.

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,040
So I get to hop over to PGE Atman and then open up.

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,500
Sequel editor there.

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,530
OK everyone.

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,400
Now I'm at PGE admen three and I'm going to go out and select my DVD rental database and run a sequel

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,940
query on it.

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,900
So just as a reminder if I expand this and show the public the schemas etc. and then show the tables

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,710
here we can see the variety of tables I have.

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,400
And right now we're going to focus on the film table.

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,530
So let's go ahead and click the database execute arbitrary sequel queery And now we can run sequel queries

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,730
on this.

00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:49,460
So let's start off by just saying select is Asterix which means select every column from film semi-colon

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,280
and in case you want a little shortcut and not have to click execute queer every time you can use EF

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,090
5 on your keyboard in order to execute that query.

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,130
Again that's just to type it out here for you.

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,170
That's EF 5 that's the hot cat clicking.

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,170
So I don't have to click execute queery every time.

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,270
Continuing on here we see that we have a film ID column a title column a description column some release

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,060
years language ID Rensil duration etc. and then some rental rates replacement costs and some more information

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,960
.

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,000
Now let's go ahead and learn how we can use distinct to grab some information that might be handy.

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,050
Let's say you wanted to know all the distinct years that films were released in your database.

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,650
So right now if we look at the number of rows our database has we scroll all the way down you'll notice

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:54,640
it has 1000 rows but you'll notice here at the very bottom we have a 2006 release year.

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,500
And as you scroll all the way up you also 2006 release here and now you're wondering is 2006 the only

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,430
release year is that if we looked at all the distinct release years as 2006 the only one.

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,370
So here's what you can do will say select

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,520
this.

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,920
And in this case we'll just select release underscore year as the column we want.

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,960
And now you'll see that it's returned all the distinct values that release your hat.

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,060
In this case it was just one year.

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,680
For whatever reason this database all the release years are from 2006.

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,350
So that's interesting something to keep in mind.

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,820
Let's go ahead and check out all the data one more time and again I know I mentioned that usually using

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,530
asterisks like this isn't good especially for a large database if you're calling everything.

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
Let's us this is a toy database for examples.

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,950
You want to worry about that right now.

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,170
Later on we'll show you how to just grab the first two columns for she rose I should say in case you

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,310
just want to call them names continue it on another interesting topic we might be interested in is the

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,260
rental rate so you can see we have a variety of rental rates such as for 99 99 cents to 99 etc..

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,750
And now I want to know what are a distinct rental rates we have for this rental DVDs store.

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:33,080
Well I'll say select listings pass in the column my wants rates and then go ahead and run this.

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,340
And so now I know that this DVDs store basically only has three rental rates.

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,830
It's either a 99 cent movie a 299 dollar movie rental rate or ifour $99 movie rental rate.

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,240
So you can see the power of select distinct statement just by itself.

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,900
Later on we'll see how we can combine the state with other sequel Syntec statements and then perform

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,760
really powerful queries to grab really specific information right and hopefully you can see just the

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,690
power of using Select Distinct on a column to grab really valuable information because if you didn't

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,580
have select distinct answering the question of well how many rental rates do you have.

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,440
Would it be a lot harder to do you'd only be able to select everything and then you have to manually

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
go through it.

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,200
Right.

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,390
So you'd have to basically sift through this thousand columns and try to find which ones are the uniques

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,580
and keep track of them.

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,090
But select the stings allows you to easily answer that question.

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,240
OK.

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,920
Go ahead and practice Select Distinct on a couple of other columns or some other tables if you want

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,120
.

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,670
But coming up next is a quick challenge to make sure you fully understand select listings.

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,820
Thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture
