00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,790
Hello everyone and welcome to the challenge lecture for the select where statements.

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,160
So in this lecture we're going to get a quick update on what the challenge structure is going to look

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,620
like for the rest of the course and then we'll get the challenges and the solutions that challenge.

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,310
There's going to be three challenges for the section.

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,010
So quick notice.

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,620
We now know enough to begin answering challenge questions posed as business tests.

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,280
So for example the challenge questions are going to be posed in the form of something like how many

00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,980
customers have the first named Jared versus previously we were being really explicit something like

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,230
use the select where statement to find Jared in the first name column of the customer table.

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,780
From now on we're actually going to focus more on business tasks or just general business questions

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,000
for example that how many customers have the first name Jared versus explicitly telling you what to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,100
do in sequel.

00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,560
The reasons for that is in a real world you're not going to be told what sequel commands to use or it's

00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
going to be told a business question.

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,640
So that's what we're going to move towards that.

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,460
And also as we go later on throughout the course there's going to be multiple ways to solve the question

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,500
or the challenge.

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,400
So we're not going explicitly say how to use your sequel query skills you're going to able to choose

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,210
the way you like the best.

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,810
OK.

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,950
So let's go in and see our first challenge and an example of this.

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,130
So the first select where challenge is this a customer forgot their wallet at our store and we need

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,920
to track down their e-mail to inform them.

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,890
So what I want you to know or give me is what's the email for the customer with the name Nancy Thomas

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,240
.

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:38,980
OK.

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,140
So again the challenge is what's the email for the customer with the name Nancy Thomas All right.

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,930
Coming up next is the solution to this query.

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,750
So go ahead and pause the video now.

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,530
You don't want to see his solution yet.

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,510
OK here's a solution.

00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,690
So a solution is to select the e-mail columns to select e-mail from customer table where first name

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,090
is equal to Nancy and the last name is equal to Thomas.

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,060
A quick note here.

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,350
There's only one person of the first name Nancy.

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,030
You could have also said where a first name equals Nancy.

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,140
OK.

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,630
So that should have given you the e-mail for Nancy Thomas.

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
Here's the next challenge.

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,720
Next challenge is a customer wants to know the movie outlaw Hinkey is about.

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,460
So could you give them a description for the movie outlaw Hinkey.

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,140
Again your challenge is to give them the description for the movie outlaw Hank.

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,770
OK.

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,660
So up next is the solution for this.

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,520
So go get impassivity now.

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,350
All right.

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,990
Now I'm going to go to the solution.

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,150
So the solution is to select that description column from the film table or the title is equal to outlaw

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,240
hanky.

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,250
Remember to put that semi-colon in see.

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,610
And the query.

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,080
OK our last challenge is this.

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,050
So the situation is a customer's late on their movie return.

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,660
And I know their address is 2 5 9 iPods right.

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,340
That's I.

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,960
P O H drive.

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,950
I want to call them to let them know that they're late on their movie return.

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,750
So can you give me the phone number for the person who lives that 4:58 9 I drive.

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:12,990
OK.

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,600
So up next is the solution to this.

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,570
So here's a solution you had a select the phone call from the address table.

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,580
So I didn't explicitly tell you what table you may have looked at the customer table first but the easiest

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,920
way to it is select phone from address where address is equal to 2 5 9 iPod drive.

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,130
OK.

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,110
So that's it for the challenges.

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,100
Great job.

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,850
And now we're going to learn some more tools and some more queries statements we can use with select

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,930
and where.

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,970
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
