00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,150
Hello everyone and welcome to your first general challenge lecture.

00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,840
So I'm really excited for you to take on this first general challenge because the general challenge

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,480
tests are going to utilize all the skills that you've learned so far you'll receive the general challenge

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,460
task and you'll get hence the challenge and then the solution to the challenge.

00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,380
These challenges are going to be a little more difficult than what you've seen earlier.

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,960
So try breaking down the problem into individual tasks in order to solve the task completely.

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,070
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,430
Your first challenge and business task that I want to answer is this.

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,350
How many payment transactions were greater than $5.

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,520
Again just what's the number that count of how many payment transactions were greater than $5.

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,300
OK.

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,620
Coming up next are the hints.

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,640
So go ahead and puzzle video.

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,530
Now if you want to see the hints here.

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,810
Moving on to the hints so you'll have to use the payments table.

00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,790
And you'll also need to use count and aware along with some sort of comparison operator in order to

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,050
distinguish what's greater than $5 so just keep that in mind.

00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:03,720
OK.

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,790
Coming up next is the solution.

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,450
So the solution is actually pretty straightforward.

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,110
You want to select counts amounts from the payment table where the amount is greater than five.

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,720
So let's take it a couple of concepts.

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,370
Just a general concept of selecting from that very first thing we learn then the concept of counting

00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,220
the amount column and then using where along of some sort of comparison operator to filter out which

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,620
amounts we were looking for.

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,490
So again that was select the counts amount column from payment table were amounts greater than 5 member

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,610
to put that semi-colon in to end your query.

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,120
Okay.

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,050
Next Business Teske how many actors have a first name that starts with the letter p.

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,340
Again how many actors have a first name that starts with the letter P.

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,470
OK.

00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,060
Coming up next is a hint.

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,610
So go ahead impassivity enough you know incident hints yet.

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,610
OK here comes the hints so you'll need to use the actor table order to answer his question.

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,350
And you'll also need to use the like statements and some sort of wild card operator such as the percent

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,060
sign or the underscore.

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,820
So go ahead and review the like lecture.

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,540
If you need any refreshment or a refresher on how to use that percent or underscore wild card operators

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,520
OK.

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,900
Coming up next is the solution to this challenge.

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,910
So here it comes.

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,860
So the solution is select count.

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,740
In this case I'm just selecting all the rows you can see and asterisks here and this because I just

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,470
want to count basically all the rows from actor where the first name column is like.

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,420
And this is where it gets a little tricky to say like a single quote.

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,310
Capital P.

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,970
Percent sign Cup quote.

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,000
And that's because what's going to happen here is you're going to say select the count asterisks meaning

00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:00,300
just count all the rows from actor where your first underscore name column is like the percent sign

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,350
.

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,410
Meaning where the value of first thing columns starts for P..

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,710
OK so go ahead and review that solution makes you type it out yourself in case you're able to get it

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,020
.

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,310
But coming up next is one other challenge task.

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,280
So here it comes.

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
OK your next challenge is how many unique districts are our customers from.

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,430
That's how many unique districts are our customers from.

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,670
OK coming up next are some hints on how to solve the challenge.

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:38,580
So here comes the hint slide so you'll need to use the address table and you'll also need to use counts

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,070
and distinct So go ahead review the distinct lecture in case you don't remember how to use distinct

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,430
but you'll need that in order to solve the challenge which was how many unique districts are our customers

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,240
from.

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,960
OK so coming up next is the solution.

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,840
So go ahead and posit it enough you want to see the solution yet.

00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,970
OK here comes a solution for it.

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,220
So the solution was to select count distinct district from address.

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,280
So this is going to basically do this is going to say select and if we start from the inside here it's

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,770
going to grab all the distinct districts.

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,980
So that means if you have for instance a district called Alberta if you have it several times throughout

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,950
that column so several rows have the value of Alberta in that the district column what the stink is

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,620
going to do is just select all the unique ones.

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,890
So it means Ill just filter it down to Alberta only shows up once or that particular district only shows

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,440
up once and then what count is going to do just counts all those distinct districts and that's basically

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,220
going to give you the answer of how many districts or unique districts other customers from and you

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,560
have to get that from the address table.

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,740
OK so one more challenge.

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,860
I want you to retrieve the list of names for those distinct districts from the previous question.

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
So this is going to be a really similar question.

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,890
I just want to make sure you really flesh out your understanding fully and just retrieve the list of

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,630
names for those distinct districts from the previous question.

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,480
OK here comes the hints.

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,130
So again you need to use the address table and really strong hint this is going to be very similar to

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,820
the previous challenge solution.

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
So it's really only editing.

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,330
Basically one word.

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,910
OK so hopefully you can get it.

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,670
But if you don't go ahead and posit video now try to get it.

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,450
And now we're going to this solution.

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,100
So here comes a solution for it.

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,330
The solution is to basically just remove that count.

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,860
So if you just say Select Distinct district from address you won't get the actual number count.

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,390
You'll just get that list of the distinct districts that the customers are from.

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,190
OK hopefully you're able to get that.

00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:00,480
Another challenge here is how many films have a rating of R and a replacement costs between $5 and $15

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,870
.

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,160
That's how many films have a rating of R and the replacement costs between $5 and $15.

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,500
OK go ahead impassivity.

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,940
Now try to solve this challenge on your own using your siecle querying skills.

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,190
And up next are some hints on how to solve this challenge.

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,450
Ok here comes the hints.

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,830
So the hint is you'll need to use the film table and you may also need to use between and a where statement

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,100
with some sort of comparison operator in order to solve that issue of between the $515.

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,750
Hopefully the word between earlier was a clue for you too.

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,240
In order for you to figure that out on your own.

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,910
OK so those are hints.

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,310
Go ahead impassivity enough you want to attempt the problem on your own.

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,450
But coming up next is the solution.

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,850
Ok here comes a solution.

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,580
So the solution was to select count Asterix so just select the count of all the rows from film where

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,510
the rating is equal to that string are a single Co.

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,670
Our single quote and replacement underscore cost column is between 5 and 15.

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,440
Notice I don't have to put strings between 5 and 15 because they're both just numeric data types.

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,630
OK so let's go to break this down a little further.

00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,250
Sometimes it confuses people why you have to just select count as tricks here.

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,770
It's sort of like title or something.

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,840
And that's because splicing count Asterix you're basically just saying count the number of rows returned

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,990
which makes sense because it doesn't matter what column you select.

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,960
You're still going to be counting the same number of rows there.

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,850
So you're saying just select the count of the number of rows from film that get returns when you select

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:36,870
.

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,360
The rating is equal to r and the replacement cost has b between 5 and 15 dollars.

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,360
OK so another challenge.

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,800
This one's going to be maybe a little trickier.

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,040
Testing your pattern matching skills.

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,420
How many films have the word Treumann somewhere in the title.

00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,460
That's how many films have the word Treumann somewhere in the title.

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,640
OK so coming up next are some hints.

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,740
Go ahead and posit that you enough and want to see those hints yet here comes the hints so you'll need

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,380
to use the film table to solve this and you'll also need to use like we have some sort of wild card

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,130
operator.

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,440
So again you can review the like lecture in order to get an understanding of how to use those wild card

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,910
operators in case you've forgotten.

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,460
All right.

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,490
I mean up next is the solution.

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,750
Here it comes.

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,780
So the solution is to select count Asterix.

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:36,110
Again we just want to select the count of the number of rows returned from film where the title column

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,400
is like.

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,880
And this is where maybe it is a little tricky for you.

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,420
But remember the question asked if we just go back to sleights here.

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,480
It asked how many films of the word Treumann somewhere in the title.

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,520
So not at the beginning not the end just anywhere in the title and that means we had to use the wildcard

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,010
operators on both ends of Treumann meaning any number of characters or any sequence of characters can

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,090
come before Truman.

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,350
And that includes spaces and any sequence characters can come after Truman.

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,590
OK so that was the solution.

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,630
So select count Asterix from film where the title is like and then single quote.

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,960
Percent sign Treumann percent sign.

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,180
Single quote semi-colons.

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,290
And that query.

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,390
All right great job.

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,090
Hopefully you found those challenges.

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,290
Straightforward a little tricky but not too hard.

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,900
This should have been pretty basic.

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,940
Well we're going to learn from now on is going to really up your skill level in school learn how to

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,010
do joints in group bhai's which are some really powerful sequel statements and that will really take

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,980
you to much more professional level understanding of sequel and the ability to use postgresql database

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,830
in order to do some real professional queries.

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,590
OK thanks everyone.

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,040
Hope you enjoy those challenges and I will see you at the next lecture.

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,430
Thanks
