00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,720
Hello everyone and welcome to the altar table lecture in this lecture room with Discover how we can

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,910
change existing tables structures even if the table already exists inside of a database and we can do

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,640
that using the ALTER TABLE statement.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,910
So the syntax of the ALTER TABLE statement is as follows.

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,120
It's Boulter table the name of your table that you want to alter and then some sort of action statement

00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,350
.

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,330
And there's quite a few different types of action statements.

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,570
So postscripts sequel in particular provides add remove or rename column actions you can set default

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,050
values for columns and check constraints to a column or rename the table itself.

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,270
So some of the keywords were going to be exploring our add column drop column rename column add a constraint

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,410
and rename to.

00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,150
So these are all actually best explored through example.

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,480
So let's go ahead and open up a sequel Ed..

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,120
Make a table and then try altering it as we go along.

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,910
So I'm going to go ahead and jump to the editor now.

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,130
OK so here I am at the sequel editor Ed. Let's go ahead and create a table to work with.

00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,480
So let's go ahead.

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,920
You may already have a table called Link.

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,040
If you have it go ahead and drop the table.

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,440
So say drop table if exists and link.

00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,940
So if you have it or not this should work.

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,630
So I already deleted the or dropped the linked table so it says Link doesn't exist.

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,670
If you had it from some of the previous lectures go ahead and run the statement in order to get rid

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,310
of it.

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,870
Because what we're going to do is create a table called link so we can play around with it.

00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,520
So we're going to say create table link and I'll just add three columns this table we're going to add

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,650
an ID column link ID that's going to be serial Primary Key going to add another column called Title

00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,650
and there will be a variable character column.

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,430
Let's go ahead and just go off some byte sizes souls say 512 variable character size.

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,190
No.

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,110
Let's go out and have a u r l.

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,210
And again the sizes don't really matter that much of what we're passing in is a variable character.

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,960
And here in passing and some come column constraints.

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,060
So I just created a table called Link.

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,250
It has three columns link ID which is the primary key of this table and it's a serial data type meaning

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,390
it's like an auto increment data type.

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,130
Then I have the title column.

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,070
It's a variable character string data type with up to 512 characters in that string and it has the constraints

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,900
of being not null so it cannot be null.

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,650
And then I have the u r l column and it's also a variable character string.

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,250
Quite a few more characters are allowed and it's not nil.

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,160
And they also all have to be unique so they all have to be unique addresses.

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,530
So let's go ahead and discover how we can use alter table to play around and mess up or play around

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,740
and mess around with this table.

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,520
So to add a new column to a table you use the add column action.

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:12,330
So you're going to say ALTER TABLE the table name ALTER TABLE link and then you say add a column and

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,250
then what you're going to do is go ahead and add the column names so let's go ahead and make a call

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,490
a name called active and then you add the data type of the column.

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,010
So I going to say that it's a Boolean type column.

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,580
So if you are Ellas active or not you know true or false.

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,620
So if I run that we went ahead and said alter table the name of the table link at column the active

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,570
column and then we made a boolean data type for that column.

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,990
So if I go ahead and check this out let's go and explore it and go ahead and say selects all from link

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,360
and we shan't get any back.

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,910
We should get at least the column names.

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,150
So if you noticed on here now I have active boolean type column.

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,880
So I was able to alter the table that already exists.

00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,500
So that's awesome.

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,870
Now let's go ahead and explore how we can drop that column.

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,720
And that's just going to be alter table the name of the table.

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,730
And you say drop call them and then the name or whatever column you want it drops so it's good it dropped

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,400
the active.

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
So it should return successfully if no results.

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,380
And if I just go ahead and say selects all asterisks from Link run that notice the active column is

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,250
no longer there.

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
So you want to rename columns.

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,170
We can do that as well.

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,480
So to say I have that title column there in the middle we can go ahead and rename it so we can say something

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:47,510
like alter table link we can say rename column and then use you pass in the column you want to rename

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,530
.

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
So let's go ahead and rename the title column.

00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:00,390
Use the keyword to and then whatever you want to do so will say like new title name and go ahead and

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,680
run that.

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,960
So you say ALTER TABLE the name of the table you say rename column title to the new title name.

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,950
So if we go ahead and explore this let's make sure that actually work by selecting from the linked table

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,460
and notice now in the middle we have that and you title name column.

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,570
Great.

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,050
So let's go ahead and explore just a couple of more actions.

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,910
So one of these other actions we can take is actually going to affect the whole table.

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,210
So instead of just affecting one column we can actually like rename the entire table.

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:42,630
So if I say select all from Link run that I get that Beletski wanted to rename the linked table I can

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,670
say alter table link and then use the Q word rename to.

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,420
And this will rename the entire table so I can name this your L table your underscore table.

00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,720
Run that.

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,590
So again it's alter table the name of the table renamed to and then the new table name.

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,900
And then we can go ahead and say selects Asterix from.

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,900
And if we try to do it from a link you'll notice link doesn't exist anymore because it's being renamed

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,670
to the real table.

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,810
And then we get the actual results.

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,410
OK.

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,730
So that's it for the basis of using alter table.

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,000
You can think of it as a nice way to alter columns and rename the table itself once a table already

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,220
exists in your database.

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,620
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
