00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,020
Hello everyone and welcome to the drop table lecture in this lecture room to learn how to remove or

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,110
drop tables from a database in post-crash sequel.

00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,820
So the syntax actually really straightforward.

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,770
If you want to remove an existing table from a database you use the drop table statement as shown in

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,240
the following below.

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,670
So you're going to say drop space table.

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,630
There's an optional if exists term and then you input the table name so that if exists term is an optional

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,930
statement which will help you avoid errors.

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,730
If a table doesn't already exist in your database.

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,970
So if you try to just say drop table some table name and table actually in your database you'll get

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,300
an error if you say drop table.

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,970
Table if exists and then some table name.

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,840
And even if that table is not in your database you won't get an error out.

00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,650
So this is best shown by a couple of simple examples in postscripts sequel.

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,630
So I'm going to go ahead and hop over to a sequel editor from PGE adamant so we can explore this just

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,700
a little further.

00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,000
All right so here I am at PGE.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,340
Adam and Eve opened up a sequel Ed..

00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:15,470
Let's go ahead and create a table real quick we'll say create a table the name of the table.

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,070
Let's go ahead and call this.

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,650
We'll just say it's called test to we'll name that.

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,780
Well let's go to like that and does it really matter in the table as long as it doesn't already exist

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,810
in your database.

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:38,760
So create this symbol table will have it have a column called Test Id just make it a serial column have

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,160
it be the primary key of the table.

00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,970
So call and run that looks like it returned successfully.

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,950
So it does create in that table test to real quick.

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,780
And now let's go ahead and just make sure it actually exists will say select Asterix from when it was

00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,760
called Test 2.

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,770
OK.

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,150
So notice we don't get any rows back but we do get that test ID column back so we know that table exists

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,720
.

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Let's go ahead and explore how to drop the table.

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,360
So it's actually quite simple.

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:18,820
The syntax for dropping table again is just drop table and then the name of the table test too.

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,600
Now I want to go ahead and run that.

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,290
So looks at the query returns loof no result.

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:33,210
So let's go ahead and make sure the tables actually dropped by saying selects Asterix from test to run

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,770
that notice.

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,170
We get an error down here.

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,780
So it says error relation to underscore does not exist which makes sense because we just deleted or

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,670
dropped that table from our database so the drop table statement worked out perfectly.

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,320
Now I want to show you what happens and how to use it if exist statement.

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,150
So imagine I try to drop this table again so that the tables not in the database.

00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,950
So we should get some sort of error here.

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,740
If I just say drop table.

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,450
So if I run that I will get the air table test to those not exists.

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,150
So they'll give you an error back if you just try to drop the table if you want to avoid getting this

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,230
error.

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,460
You can say if

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,280
exists test too.

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,160
And now if I run this query it will say a notice instead of a full error will give you a notice saying

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,990
table test 2 does not exist.

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,030
Skipping.

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,210
And then also a clear return successfully.

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,020
So it will execute the query give you a quick notice telling you that the table doesn't exist but it

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,190
won't throw back an error.

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,530
So if you have this sort of statement somewhere along in your code somewhere you won't just disrupt

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,190
your program.

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,540
It'll keep on going.

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,980
So again that's stropped table if exists.

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,810
All right.

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,970
That's basically it for the drop table.

00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,490
You can check out the documentation.

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,320
There's another key word that's actually already automatically input but there's a key word that you

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,540
can put after your table known as restricts.

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,030
And basically what restrict does is restrict refuses to drop the table if there's any objects dependent

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,960
on it.

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,150
So postgres sequel use restrict that by default.

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,050
So just keep that in mind if you want to move.

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:25,500
Remove this table that has dependencies on it and you want to remove the dependent objects together

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,780
.

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,040
You can put in the keyword cascade.

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,120
We'll discuss cascade and restrict a little more because it has the pins a little more in like views

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,830
and constraints that actual tables themselves.

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,900
So just keep in mind if you want to drop a table and your table has constraints or the pendency is on

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,270
that or other objects that the pendant on that table you're trying to draw or it's use in some sort

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,990
of view that we haven't actually discussed yet with the view section is enough.

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,280
Further a section of course you can put in cascade.

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,960
So by default restricts will always be there so you don't actually have to say restricts if you don't

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,100
want to.

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,570
OK.

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,380
So you can go and explore documentation for a little more info on Cascade and restrict.

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,220
But right now all you need to know for this section of course is just say drop table if exists.

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,770
And then the table name.

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,080
OK that's it for this lecture.

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,890
Thanks everyone.

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,590
I'll see you at the next one.
