00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,330
Hello everyone and welcome to this overview on creating databases and tables section of the course in

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,310
this section of the course we're going to be learning how to create database and tables and manipulate

00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,230
the data inside of them.

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,320
So previously in the other sections we've been mainly reading from tables or databases where the data

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,500
is already in there and it already exists.

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,110
We've been learning how to read data from them.

00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,340
So in this section we're going to focus on is how you actually create those tables and insert data into

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,730
those tables and cells using sequel syntax.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,610
So if your profession or job has some sort of analyst is going to mainly consist of just reading from

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,860
tables you're not actually ever going to have to input your own data through sequel syntax directly

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,700
.

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,120
This entire section may not be super useful but it will help you build a better understanding of how

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,030
these databases and tables actually interact with each other.

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,040
And Ill even give you a good understanding of how web application databases work.

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,670
So a quick note.

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,240
Many of the concepts in this section are interconnected.

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,080
Meaning it's a bit difficult to teach them in any sort of proper order.

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,170
And the what I mean by that is let's say there's concept a concept B there's no real order to cause

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,320
it.

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,290
A first is concept B second because you kind of need to learn both of them at the same time in order

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,260
to use one or the other.

00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,040
So keep that in mind if a video alerts you to something that will be addressed in more detail in a future

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,900
lecture.

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,350
So if there's ever a situation like this you'll hear me point out don't worry we're going to learn about

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,020
this topic in a future lecture.

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,990
However I have tried my best in order to present all the data and all the lectures in a straightforward

00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:52,400
and orderly manner so that straightforward and orderly matter is going to start like this.

00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,260
We're going to start at understanding data types in a little more detail.

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,160
Now we're also going to go over what primary and foreign keys are in more detail then we practice creating

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,640
tables and manipulating the data rows inside of them and then we'll learn how to manipulate entire tables

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,120
.

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,970
And then finally we're going to end some more in view of some constraint concepts and we'll cover what

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,650
constraints are in a future lecture.

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,690
So quick note.

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,560
This section will really focus on challenges too much because a lot of the syntax in this section is

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,230
actually going to correspond exactly to what you would expect for normal phrasing.

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,930
So for example of a challenge question asked Oh create a table called Test table.

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,040
Well a lot of the syntax really matches up and basically says exactly what it does.

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,450
So the answer to that question would just be create table test table and you're going to notice that

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,610
as you go along.

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's say there's another question that says oh insert these values into a table.

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,320
The syntax for that is actually going to be insert blank values blank.

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,560
So this entire section doesn't really lend itself well to challenge questions because the questions

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,750
that essentially just give away the answer.

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,120
So this entire section is really more to beef up your own knowledge and just build an understanding

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,460
of how databases and tables are created and how they work.

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,170
So as always feel free to ask any discussion questions for hints tips extra resources or information

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,580
or to clear up any confusion on any of these topics.

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,240
With that being said let's go ahead and get started.

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,480
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
