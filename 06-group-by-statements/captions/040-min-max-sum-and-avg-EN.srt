00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,770
Hello everyone and welcome to the min max average in some lecture and these are all what are known as

00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,060
aggregate functions.

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,330
And we're going to be using every functions a lot when we learn about group by in the next lecture.

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,560
So I wanted just to introduce to you some of these aggregate functions we've actually already used one

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,980
of them called Count counters another example of an aggregate function and aggregate functions do is

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,630
they basically take a lot of information or a lot of rows of data and aggregate it or combine it into

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,610
a single value.

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,730
So you can imagine what a some aggregate function does is it adds up all that data combines to a single

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,810
value.

00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,590
And in the same way minimax an average take in all these rows of data and combine it to a single value

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,980
.

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,100
A lot of these are really self-explanatory in their use.

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,290
But we're going to go ahead and show you quick simple examples of all of them.

00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,220
There will be a challenge because these are all pretty easy to understand.

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,350
So let's just go ahead and dive straight into PGE admin and see examples of all these.

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,380
OK so here we are at PGE admin.

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,810
I'm going to go ahead and click on DVD rental execute arbitrary SQL query and what I'm going to do is

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,720
just show you quick examples of all those aggregate functions.

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,400
So let's go ahead and use the payment table to do this on the say select Asterix meaning all columns

00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,430
from the payments table.

00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,400
And it's going to limit this just to five rows so you don't get a whole bunch stuff back.

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,710
OK.

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,870
So let's look for a nice numerical column.

00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,660
It looks like to me a nice to work column to play around with as far as the aggregate functions would

00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,550
be the amount column.

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,960
So how much that amounts payment was actually four.

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,500
So we have a bunch of dollar figures here.

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,820
So 7 9 9 189 et cetera.

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,160
And we're going to do is go ahead and mess around with the agri functions for them.

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,600
So aggregate functions are used a lot with the group by statement.

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,850
And what we're going to do is just show you how you can use them without a group by statement.

00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:08,040
So it is common to do this without a group by statement because I agree it functions really show their

00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,160
power with GROUP BY together.

00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,260
But maybe you do want to just get a general idea for the entire data base you have.

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,480
So let's say we want to know what's the average amounts paid.

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:29,490
I would just say the average amount from payment and let's go ahead and delete this limit line even

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,040
though we should only get basically one number back.

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,240
So if I just say five here and that's the average amount paid $4 and 20 something cents notice I get

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,460
a lot of decimal points back.

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,700
And if you want to reduce the number of decimal points which I've actually just jumped to and shown

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,320
you here but I haven't actually put that code in yet you can use the round function.

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,300
So let's go in and run this again.

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,500
So notice here and have a bunch of decimal points in a kind of jumped in the video.

00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,580
This isn't editing.

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,900
But let's go ahead and reduce this so we just get it to two decimal points since this is money that's

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,270
really all we care about up to the second decimal place.

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,960
So to do that I can use round and I can say select and then I have round that I'm going to go ahead

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,050
and pass in the average amounts that number that I want around Khama.

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,100
And then the number of decimal places I want around too.

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,230
So let's say just want around to two places pass the decimal and if I go ahead and run this then I get

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,860
four dollars and 20 cents here for one more decimal points.

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,890
I can just add in a different number here.

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,210
Run it it'll give me that many decimal places past that point.

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,870
So in this case I put in five and we can use round in order to round that average or a man or Max whatever

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,660
the aggregate function is two more decimal places.

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,610
OK so we won't be using round too often just because you can call it if you need it and it's just faster

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,940
for demonstration purposes or for doing stuff just to go ahead and run it like this and then call the

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,070
average here with all the decimal places.

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,110
Usually I'm not going to need that many decimal places but throughout the course we won't be using around

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,190
too much just because it's a lot faster to type out average.

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,440
And now that we know how to use round you can do it on your own.

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,440
So again if you want to use round you just take the numerical column amount that you're trying to pass

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,230
type in around and it basically takes in essentially two arguments here.

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,900
The first is the number you actually want to round and then you say comma and put in the number of decimal

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,280
places you want around 2.

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,760
So for instance two decimal places five to run it.

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,860
And I have that round that number.

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,500
OK.

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,450
So let's go ahead to learn about couple more aggregate functions.

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,210
Another useful one is men for minimum.

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,980
And if we just say select men and let's go in and select the minimum rental or payment rates.

00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,380
And that would be the amount column.

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,780
So I want to select the minimum amount anyone ever paid and or process can go ahead and say five here

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,010
.

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,470
And that's interesting the minimum amount was $0.

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,680
So that might be something we might want to check into.

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,080
So let's go ahead and check into that by saying selects amounts.

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:27,660
And let's go ahead and order by the amounts ordered by amounts and see if we can find out a little more

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,510
about this so if we order by amount you'll notice we have actually a lot of zeros in the beginning.

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,090
So that might be an interesting question to ask ourselves later why are there so many zeros there and

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,820
let's say we actually want to count how many there were.

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,290
We could say select counts which is another aggregate function.

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:56,670
So count the number of occurrences amount from payments and then we're going to say where Count is equal

00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,410
to.

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:04,860
And let's say hosers or and notice we get an error here and that's because I wasn't paying attention

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,750
and this should not been count that should have been amounts got confused there for a second because

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,650
they rhyme.

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,150
But here we go we have 24 instances of the amount being $0.

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,330
So that's interesting.

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,120
Pay attention to this because you may asked something similar in a challenge later on.

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,120
So just a quick hint there.

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,940
Anyways let's go ahead and continue on.

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,190
So we have min and max.

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:38,460
So if we just go ahead and check the max amounts anyone ever paid from payments max amount was $11 99

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,980
cents.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,980
OK that makes sense.

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
We already took the average amounts.

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,440
And one of the last ones I want to show you is some and what some will do is just basically add all

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,930
those amounts together from payment.

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,340
So the entire sum.

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,080
So all the payments sum together is sixty one thousand three hundred twelve dollars and four cents.

00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,160
OK.

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,170
Those are the real basics of Agri function.

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,640
So let's just go ahead and review what we learned we learned about from just going to type them here

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,290
.

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:15,780
We learned about men Max some average and we briefly again went over counts which we've seen before

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,070
.

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,170
So we went over minimax some average count and then we also learned how we can use round.

00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:28,770
So let's go ahead and redo that so I can use round two round numeric values so I'm going to say round

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,720
first argument you passen is the column that's going to be a number.

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,570
Then you say comma and you put in the number of decimal places you want.

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,030
So in this case say I want one decimal place.

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,140
If I run this I will go ahead and chop off that 4 and run that down to zero.

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,790
OK.

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,510
Thanks everyone for listening to this lecture.

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,240
Again pretty basic stuff just the aggregate functions minimax some Furch count and then how to use round

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,650
.

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,700
Coming up next we'll learn how to use GROUP BY which is going to use a lot of these functions to be

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,090
our source for really powerful sequel queries.

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,610
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
